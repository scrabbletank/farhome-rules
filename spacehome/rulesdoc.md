## Character

### Categories and Skills
Character's skills are broken down into several categories. Improving a category improves every skill under that category. Characters gain points every level they can spend on upgrading categories.

### Making a Character
Start by choosing a species. Species determines starting wounds, movement, initial feat, etc. Choose 7 of the 25 skills to be proficient in. Assign 4 points to categories. Categories cannot go above 3 during character creation. Choose a feat you meet the requirements for.

### Leveling Up
When leveling up, you get 2 points to improve your character. You can spend them on anything you want, but cannot choose the same category twice in a single level. Eg: You can't put 2 points into Athletics, but can put 1 into Athletics and 1 into Martial.

In addition, you can spend points to improve other aspects of your character. Some of these require multiple points, and points can be acrued over multiple levels. Eg: You can put 1 point into increasing your wounds now, and then at the next level put in another point.

### Hit Points
There are 3 main pools of hit points: Wounds, Armor, and Shielding. Armor and Shielding are provided by your equipment, and in most cases are mutually exclusive. Damage is always taken in this order: Shielding, Armor, Wounds.

#### Wounds
Wounds are your bodily health. When you run out of them you die. Health is hard to heal on its own. You recover 1 wound every day. Wounds can be fully recovered at any city with a proper hospital in moments.

#### Armor
Armor is provived by your equipment. Armor has two properties: Points and Rating. Points determine how many wounds this armor can take before breaking. Rating is a measure of the armor's damage reduction. When taking damage, any damage lower than the armor's Rating is reduced to 1 wound, and any damage greater than the armor's Rating is reduced by that amount.

Armor that has been fully broken, ie. has lost all of its Points, provides no benefit until repaired. Armor that has been damaged or fully broken can be fixed during a rest or in any city with a mechanic.

#### Shielding
Shielding is provided by your equipment. Like armor, Shielding has two properties: Points and Recharge. Points determine how many wounds the shielding absorbs before breaking, and Recharge determines how many points of Shielding are restored each round. Shields that have no more Points remaining do not give any of their benefits.

### Energy
Energy is used by Espers to cast spells and perform Weavings. Energy is fairly limited, but characters restore all of their energy after a short or long rest.

## Rolls
Rolls in this game use the same dice as Farhome (with the exception of defense dice) and use an altered method of calculating rolls. All rolls are based off of 1 of the 25 skills. Starting with 5 white dice, replace a white die with a green die for each point of proficiency in a skill. Once all white dice have been replaced, replace green dice with yellow dice for each remaining proficiency. Any proficiency above 10 adds a flat success for every point above 10.

### Skill Proficiency
Skill proficiencies are calculated based off the proficiency of the category they are under. Skills that you are proficient in (The skills you choose at character creation or learned through level ups) gain the full benefit of the categories proficiency. All other skills have a proficiency equal to half the categories level, rounded down.

### Death Saves
When you lose all your life, you begin making death saving throws. Death saves use your Survival skill, with an increasing difficulty every roll. Failing a death save puts you in a critical state for the next day. While in a critical state, the next death save you fail kills you. You remain in a critical state even if you are stablized or healed until you have completed a long rest.

Death saves start against 1 terrible die, increasing by 1 for each roll.

## Gear
A good chunk of character progression comes from the gear they use. Normally a character can wear a single piece of armor and use a single Caster. Outside of those items characters can equip gear up to their loadout limit. By default this limit is 6, and some pieces of gear cost more or less loadout points. This doesn't mean you cant use things that aren't in your loadout, it's just your loadout is what is immediately available to you. You can change your loadout at any time by spending a full round swaping things out of your pack. You can change any number of items when changing your loadout, as long as your total equipped items are less than your loadout limit.

Loadout limit can be increased through feats, armor, or even some gear.

### Mods
Most weapons and Casters come with a set number of modifier slots. For weapons, this default is usually 1, while Casters can have a varied amount. Modifier slots can be equiped with Mods that alter the gear in some way. For example, you can equip a laser sight onto a weapon to make it accurate at range, or a capacitor into a Caster to increase the energy you can use at one time. Mods can be swapped out freely during a short or long rest.

Some modifiers may increase the loadout points of the item it is socketed into.

### Bonus Modifiers (+1/2/3)
Some gear comes with Bonus Modifiers, displayed as a number after their name. For example, Las Pistol +1, or Carapice Armor +2. By default, Bonus Modifiers increase the number of Modifier slots on an item for non-armor gear, or increases the Point value for armor/shielding gear.

### Casters
Casters are special equipment used by Psykentic and Machine Soul Espers to use their abilities. Casters channel the innate energy in a person to power any of the spells socketed inside. As spells are physical devices they have to be socketed into a Caster, taking up a mod slot. Due to this, Casters tend to have many more mod slots than other items. Casters have an energy limit, increasable with mods, that determines the maximum amount of energy that can be expended at one time. Spells that require more energy than the casters limit can't be used by that caster.

#### Sustained Spells
There's no more concentration saves, instead some spells have the Sustained tag. While a spell is sustained it reduces the energy limit of the caster by the energy spent on the spell. You can stop sustaining a spell at any time, causing the effects of the spell to end.

## Espers
Spells in this game are much flatter than farhome. For example, there is no spell level. As long as you have the spell capsule socketed into a caster you can cast the spell. Instead, all spells can be empowered by spending more energy. The amount of energy you can spend is based on the casters energy limit, with spells having varied base energy costs.

Spells have a base cost ranging from 0-4. Spells that cost 0 are considered cantrips and can be cast even when the user has no energy left.

## Robot Pets
You can find or build your own robot companion. While having a companion with you your loadout limit is reduced. Companions have their own base stats, along with their own loadout limit. Robots can only equip robot specific items into their loadout, and their loadout can only be changed by an engineer in a proper facility. 

Robots have no Wounds, instead using Armor Points. A campanion that loses all of its Armor Points is broken and no longer functions. Companions can be patched up over a short or long rest. Characters make an Engineering roll, repairing armor based on the roll. Each time a companion is broken it loses access to one of its loadout, only regaining access after being properly repaired at a facility.

Autonomous companions act on your turn, taking their actions when you do. Some companions can be Piloted, such as a Mech Suit. These kinds of companions follow the same rules as normal robot pets, but require an active pilot to take any action.

## Combat

### Initiative
Spacehome uses a simple initiative system. Each creature in combat places a colored die in a bag. Creatures that act on the same initiative, such as characters with robot pets, do not add extra dice. Dice are drawn from the bag one at a time. When a party memebr or or allied die is drawn, the players choose a party member or ally to activate. When a enemy die is drawn, the game master chooses an enemy to activate. Each creature can only activate once per round.

Some situations can cause dice to be added to the initiative bag. For example, when one side is ambushing another they add up to 3 additional dice, depending on how surprising the ambush is, how prepared they were, etc. Likewise, some Abilities can add dice for the following round, making it more likely for one side to act.

As each creature can only act once per turn, when drawing a die for a team that has no more creatures left to act, the dice is ignored and discarded. Any dice added to the bag last for only a single round. For example, only the first round of combat gets the bonus from surprise.


## Feats
A bunch of ideas for feats, in no particular order.

**Close Combat**
You add 3 successes to Reflex saves against attacks, abilities, or effects that are adjacent to you.

**Heavy Loadout**
Your Loadout Limit is increased by 3.

**Longshot**
Add 1 success when making Ranged attacks against a target 6 tiles or further. In addition, if no enemy is within 6 tiles of you add a critical to your Ranged attacks.

**Skirmisher**
Hiding behind cover gives you +1 success to defense rolls.

**Armor Specialist**
When an attack would break your armor, if the damage would not outright kill you, prevent all wounds lost from the attack.

**Light Loadout**
While you are 3 points below your Loadout Limit, your movespeed is increased by 1.

**Ace Pilot**
When making a Piloting check, you may remove a single bad or terrible die from the challenge. You must take a long or short rest to use this feat again.

**Careful Hacking**
When making a Hacking check, as long as you do not critically fail you will not raise any alarm.

**Scavenger**
You can attempt to salvage spare parts from defeated robots/mechs. A successful Engineering roll allows you to restore 1d3 Armor Points for a creature or repair a damaged subsystem of a robot pet.
