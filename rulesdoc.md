# Preface

What once started as a series of homebrew rules has turned into a full-fledged rule book. Inside this book is a set of rules that many of you will be familiar with. Anyone who's played a fantasy tabletop role playing game has probably rolled dice to hit a goblin, made an athletics check to kick down a door, or cast an iconic fireball into a crowd of monsters. The rules in this book describe an alternate way to play the same game we've been playing for ages, one that hopefully gives a simplified, more engaging experience that offers players more _freedom_ with their characters. And _fun_, because I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't have fun playing it.

There are a few things here you won't find elsewhere, however. There are **no classes** in Farhome. Instead you are given a blank slate. **Backgrounds** help define who your character was before becoming an adventurer, leaving how they grow and advance up to you. Combat has been streamlined with **action points**, giving you more options in playing your turn. Dice rolls are always **contested** by either the GM or another player, keeping the game active and engaging. Dice rolls also use a **success/failure** system instead of adding numbers, with failure (and success!) always being a possibility.

While many things have been simplified, there's still loads of depth in these rules. They offer more ways to be creative with your characters and their actions, providing opportunities for teamwork while still giving each character their space to shine. Which is neat.

## What is Farhome?

Farhome is a tabletop role playing system set in a fantasy world of magic, monsters, and adventures. You and a group of friends play as adventurers, exploring and interacting with a world created by another one of your friends, the Game Master. While the rules in the book give structure to how your adventurers interact with the world, largely the game is driven by you and your friends' imaginations. 

You won't find any rules in this book about what you need to roll to climb up an ogre's back, but that doesn't mean your adventurer can't try. For every scenario that isn't handled by the book it's ultimately up to the Game Master to decide how it happens, or if it's possible. In this respect the players work together with the Game Master; the players describing the actions they want to take and the Game Master describing the outcome of those actions and how the world responds.

At the end of the day Farhome is a game about creativity, imagination, and having fun with your friends. It is a _collaborative_ experience, working with the Game Master to tell a story. With that being said you can expect to experience the following:
- battle goblins and orcs
- delve into dangerous dungeons
- find wondrous treasures, magical trinkets, or ancient weapons
- explore an ancient wode, a scorching desert, or the depths below the mountains
- meet noble kings and nefarious villains
- solve challenging puzzles and avoid deadly traps
- come to an untimely death
- roll a lot of dice along the way
  
## How to Play

Before you begin, you and your friends will need to determine who will be the Game Master. The Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the world, handling all the locations, monsters, and people in the world, while everyone else is in charge of an adventurer, or character. Usually the GM is played by the same person every game, but in some games it makes sense to rotate that responsibility. Regardless, the GM acts as the main storyteller, or referee. If there's ever any confusion as to how something works, or if the players want to do something that this book doesn't cover the GM has the final say on what happens.

Farhome follows a narrative gameplay loop: the GM begins by describing the environment the adventurers are in, the players describe what they want their adventurers do, and finally the GM describes the results of those actions. This is the core of the game and is seen in every aspect of the game. For example, the GM could be describing the dungeon your group of adventurers are exploring, giving the players a basic set of actions they could follow (the layout of the room, how many doors there are, if the adventurers see any creatures, and so on). The players then tell the GM what they want their characters to do, such as opening a door, searching for traps, or attacking a monster. The GM then describes the results of their actions: the door may be locked, or they find a poison dart trap, or surprise the monster. This often leads to another choice for the players, which starts the narrative loop all over again. This gameplay loop continues whether the players are exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or investigating for clues in a town.

Each time your group meets to play you can expect to spend 2-3 hours playing. During this time you can reasonably expect to: meet and interact with a notable non-player character (or NPC), explore a new location, fight dangerous monsters, and find something memorable. While some sessions you might never interact with an NPC, or encounter any monsters, it's these 4 experiences that build an adventure.

Adventures usually have a distinct beginning and end. As an example an adventure may require you to save a village from monsters. You will need to talk to the villagers and gather information about what's attacking them. The villagers may tell you the monsters live in the forest outside town, which you will need to explore. On finding the monster's lair you come up with a plan to defeat it, and after defeating it return to the village where they reward you with a magical sword. Your group may finish an adventure in a single session, or it might take many sessions, spanning many locations, people, and monsters.

When one adventure ends, another can begin. This string of quests and adventures is called a campaign. Campaigns can span months or years, with each adventure adding to one large story. Your character might die over the course of the campaign, either at the hand of a dangerous monster, villain, or any manner of way. You friends might search for a way to revive you, or you might create a new character. Over the course of the campaign your group may fail, or everyone may meet their demise. Even so, at the end of the day a successful campaign is one where everyone is able to have a good time, regardless of if your characters 'win' or 'lose'.


With that out of the way, how exactly do you start playing Farhome? Well, that part is fairly easy. The following pages describe everything from rolling dice, creating a character, and how combat works. With this you and your friends should be able to create a group of adventurers ready to explore a new and exciting world.

## GM Quick Start Guide

Creating a world of infinite possibilities can seem like a daunting task, and well, that's because it is. This book is woefully lax in guidelines on how to run the game, but I can at least get you started and out the door. Thankfully that won't take much, as while the world is infinite the space the characters are interacting with is tiny and constrained. For now anyways, more on that later.

To start, you'll need a minimum of 3 things: A town, a dungeon, and an obstacle for the players to overcome. Your players have to start somewhere in your world, and that place is usually a town. You don't need much for a town, a few names for the people living there, a tavern for players to meet them, and 1 or 2 places for your players to interact with, such as the mayors house or blacksmith.

Next is a dungeon. It doesn't have to be a literal dungeon, it could be an abandoned temple, a cave, or the lair of some ferocious beast. Whatever it is, it should be big enough for the players to explore, but not too big to get lost in. This usually means 2 or 3 rooms or 'encounters'. Your dungeon may have traps to prevent entry, or be filled with hostile creatures, or both! It needs something that adds challenge and danger for your players when they explore it. It also needs a reward for completing it. A magic item held by the strongest creature in the dungeon, or some treasure hidden behind the most dangerous traps.

Finally we need a reason for the players to explore the dungeon, the obstacle. This can be anything that motivates your players, for example the blacksmiths daughter was kidnapped and is being held there, it could contain a cure for a disease plaguing the town (and now players!), or it even could be a rumor of treasure. The obstacle serves to tie the town to the dungeon in a way that motivates the players. The players learn about the obstacle in the town, and head to the dungeon to overcome it.

With those 3 things you have your first adventure and are ready to run your first game. Making your second adventure will be easier than your first, you already have the town after all. As your game progresses, so does the world you created, adding other towns and villages as you need them. Maybe this land is ruled by a king, or some fiendish villain is plotting against the players behind the scenes.

As your players experience your world they will eventually want to branch out. They may get access to spells making travel easier, want to seek out that dastardly villain, or just want to explore. Eventually you'll need a big world for them to explore, but all of that starts with a town, a dungeon, and an obstacle.

# Playing The Game

### Rolling Dice

Farhome uses a set of 6-sided dice to determine outcomes. There are 9 types of 6-sided dice, each with their own layout of successes or failures. With most dice rolls you roll a set of dice determined by your characters skills or abilities, adding challenge dice depending on the difficulty of the task. Rolling more successes than failures means your action succeeded. Sometimes your roll is contested by another character's roll. In these cases ties always go to the defender.

Some dice have special symbols on them for Triumphs and Disasters. A Triumph adds 2 success and a critical, while a Disaster adds 2 failures and removes a critical. When rolling a Disaster, if you have no criticals to remove you instead add a critical to the opposing roll. Defense dice work similarly to the other dice, having defense symbols instead of successes. Finally wound dice are used to determine damage, healing, or in some cases chance.

### Calculating a Roll
After making a roll add up all your successes and criticals, negating your successes by the number of failures rolled. Keep in mind that triumphs count as both 2 successes and a critical. For example, 2 failures can negate the successes from a triumph, but it doesn't negate the critical from that roll. Some abilities allow you to reroll dice or change the result of a die which can change the outcome of your roll. Almost every roll is contested by either the GM adding challenge dice to your roll or by another creature's roll. The roll is a success if you have more successes than your opponent, with ties favoring the defender if there is one, or the most neutral action.

Remember that rolls contested by a creature can change the outcome of your roll. The defenders criticals negate any criticals you have in your roll. For example, if you have more total successes than the opponents roll, but they rolled more criticals than you, the action succeeds but does not trigger any critical effects.

#### Determining What Dice to Roll
With the exception of defense rolls, your attributes and proficiencies determine what dice you roll. Defense rolls use defense and superior defense dice, while other rolls use superior, enhanced, normal, bad, and terrible dice. Wound dice are used to determine how much damage an action does, such as hitting a goblin with a sword or casting the _Firebolt_ spell.

Rolls that use your attributes roll dice depending on your attribute and proficiency scores, with different skills using different attributes and proficiencies. For example, attacking with melee weapons uses your Strength attribute and has a different proficiency score depending on if you're using a one-handed or two-handed weapon. For attribute rolls you start with 5 normal dice. For every attribute point you have replace a normal die with an enhanced die. Next, for every proficiency point you have, replace an enhanced die with a superior die. Proficiency does not replace normal dice; you only benefit from a proficiency score equal to or less than your attribute score.

In the case where you have a negative number for your attribute score, replace a normal die with a bad die. If your proficiency score is negative, replace an enhanced die with a normal die, or a bad die with a terrible die.

Through feats, spells, or items you may have an attribute score greater than 5. In this case for every attribute score above 5 you have you add an enhanced die.

#### Defense Rolls
Defense rolls use defense and superior defense dice. The number and type of dice you roll is determined by what armor your wearing. You roll 2 defense dice while not wearing armor, instead rolling the armors dice value if you have armor equipped. Holding a shield adds either a defense or superior defense die, depending on the shield.

#### Attribute Saves
Attribute saves use the same rules as rolling a skill with one exception: negative attribute scores do not replace normal dice with bad dice. This means that the lowest you can roll is 5 normal dice. However, other effects, such as being poisoned, still add dice. In almost every case when you roll an attribute save you are seen as the defender, with the roll siding in your favor on a tie.

In some cases your GM may ask you to make a raw attribute roll. Rolling a raw attribute uses your attribute save proficiency and is affected by negative scores.

#### Wound Dice
Many attacks and spells deal wounds or wound dice to their targets. When an attack says it deals wound dice you roll that many wound dice, dealing damage based on the number of wounds rolled. For example, a spell that deals 1 wound and 2 wound dice in damage will deal 1 wound, adding the result of the 2 wound dice in damage to the target.

#### Hero Dice
Hero dice are special dice players can add to any roll. Depending on the GM, you'll gain a number of them at the start of your adventure and once spent are not replenished. You can add at most 1 hero die to any roll, except wound rolls, and you may choose to add a hero dice after you have rolled. Hero dice are immune to any effects that would change the outcome of the roll, it cannot be hexed, rerolled, or negated.

Your GM may reward you with extra hero dice during your adventure, but hero dice are usually only given at the start of each adventure.

#### Skill Challenge
Skill challenges are rarely made in contest, instead the GM will ask you to add dice depending on the challenge of the task you are trying to accomplish. Each skill has its own proficiency score and uses one of your attributes to determine dice. For example, an athletics check will use your Strength score while an acrobatics check will use your Dexterity score.

The outcome in these rolls isn't always a strict pass or fail. Depending on the GM they may give a bonus if you roll a critical or something bad may happen if you roll a disaster without a triumph. For skill challenges the character is always considered the _attacker_, with a tie or a final result of 0 counting as a failure.

#### Helping in Skill Challenges
In some cases you may want to help someone with an action, such as trying to push a boulder or search a room. When helping every participant rolls the same skill check and is contested by a single challenge roll. The highest roll among the participants is used, adding a success for every critical rolled by others.

##### Skill Challenge Difficulty

|            |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| :--------: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   Simple   | B    | _    | _    | _    | _    | _    | _    |
|    Easy    | B    | B    | _    | _    | _    | _    | _    |
|  Average   | B    | B    | T    | _    | _    | _    | _    |
|    Hard    | B    | B    | T    | T    | _    | _    | _    |
| Difficult  | B    | B    | B    | T    | T    | T    | _    |
| Impossible | B    | B    | T    | T    | T    | T    | T    |

#### Rerolls
Either through expertise, feats, or other abilities you may reroll a number of dice when making a roll. When rerolling you may choose any dice, except wound dice, to reroll taking the new value instead. Once rerolled you may not reroll the same die again. You may reroll any dice that are considered part of your roll, such as bonus dice from upcasting a spell, dice added from abilities or spells such as _Guidance_, and dice given by negative effects, such as poison. When making a skill challenge, all challenge dice are considered part of your roll and may be rerolled. 

Dice rolled in contest of your own roll, such as another creatures defense or attribute save rolls, cannot be rerolled by you. Additionally, dice that have been replaced, such as dice that have been hexed, cannot be rerolled.

#### Adding Dice
Some abilities allow you to add dice to certain rolls. Dice that are added as part of upcasting a spell or from abilities that apply to your next roll must be added and rolled together. Hero dice, or abilities that allow you to add dice to any roll within a timeframe can be added after your roll, but before the outcome is determined.

For example, dice added from the spells _Guidance_ or _Weal_ add dice to your next roll that satisfies the condition. These dice must be added the next time you make that roll. Dice added by the _Inspiring Words_ maneuver can be added to any roll made in the timeframe. If you wanted to add _Inspiring Words_ to your attack, you may wait to see the opponents defense before adding the superior die. Similarly, your opponent can wait to see your attack roll before deciding to add dice to their defense roll.

### Wounds

Wounds are used to determine how hard a character is to kill, the more wounds you have the more durable your character. Wounds are lost when you are hit by attacks, spells, or traps and are restored by taking rests or through certain spells. If you are brought to 0 wounds or below you become incapacitated and start making death saves. Some attacks and spells can kill your character outright, bypassing death saves. Regardless of the source, taking damage equal to or exceeding your maximum wounds will kill you.

#### Temporary Wounds

Some abilities give temporary wounds instead of healing missing wounds. When taking damage you remove any temporary wounds first, dealing any remaining damage to your wounds. Once lost, temporary wounds do not come back and cannot be healed, however whenever you gain new temporary wounds you add them to your total. You may have a maximum of half your health, rounded up, in temporary wounds at any given time.

#### Injuries

Some abilities or spells inflict lasting injuries. Injuries come in two varieties: Minor and Major Injuries. Minor injuries are short lived, can be easily cured through rest or magic, and are often only a mild hinderance to your character. At the end of each successful long rest you recover from a minor injury. If you have multiple minor injuries you choose which injury to recover first.

Major Injuries are long lasting, debilitating injuries that can have major effects on your character. While most major injuries can be healed over time some specific injuries can only be healed through magic. Every week that you have a major injury you make a Stamina save against 4 terrible dice, ending its effects on success.

### Action Points

Action points (AP) are used during combat to move, attack, or cast spells. Characters start with 10 action points and at the start of each of your characters turns your action points are refilled. Aside from a few actions (listed in the Combat section) there is no limit on which actions you can take on your turn. Any unspent action points can be spent on reactions when it's not your turn. Reactions are triggered by specific actions other creatures take. For example, opportunity attacks can only be made when a creature tries to leave your zone of control.

### Death Saves

When a character takes enough damage to bring them to 0 wounds they are incapacitated and start making death saves. While incapacitated you gain temporary wounds equal to half your total wounds rounded up. At the start of each turn you roll a wound die, losing 1 of your temporary wounds if the die rolls a wound. If you lose all of your temporary wounds your character dies.

Death saves aren't the only way you can lose temporary wounds. Creatures can still make attacks against you and any melee attacks that hit you deal full damage regardless of the wound dice rolled. Likewise, allies can attempt to bring you back with healing spells, potions, or by stabilizing you. While in this state healing effects restore any lost temporary wounds first. If this brings you 1 wound or above you regain consciousness and no longer make death saves.

You can attempt to stabilize a character by making a medicine check. The check takes 10 AP and you must be beside the downed character to make it. Roll a medicine check, adding a terrible die for every temporary wound the character is missing. On success the character is stabilized, with failure restoring a temporary wound for every critical in your medicine check. A stabilized player's wounds are set to 1 and they no longer make death saving throws, gaining consciousness after 10 minutes.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities that can be learned by your character. They can be learned by anyone, but most maneuvers require a weapon to be used. Using a maneuver is the same as taking any other action during your turn, however they have the following restrictions:

- You may only use one maneuver per turn, reaction maneuvers excluded.
- You cannot use the same maneuver two consecutive rounds in a row.

Most maneuvers have weapon requirements, or can only be used in specific situations, such as when an ally is attacked. Each maneuver has a level requirement which is shown as 3 levels, the first being the level requirement to learn the maneuver, the second when it becomes **enhanced**, and the third when it becomes **superior**. When your character reaches the maneuver's enhanced or superior levels it gains the effects described in its **enhanced** and **superior** textblocks.


### Healing Surge

Healing surges are used to heal wounds your character has suffered and are spent during a short or long rest. Your character starts with healing surges equal to your Stamina score (minimum of 1) and gains an extra healing surge every 10 levels. When spending a healing surge you roll 3 wound dice, healing for the number of wounds rolled. You can spend any number of healing surges during a short or long rest. After each long rest you regain up to 3 of your spent healing surges.

### Combat Advantage

Some abilities may impose combat advantage against you or an enemy. Someone who grants combat advantage is easier to hit, giving anyone who makes an attack, maneuver, or spell attack against the creature an extra superior die to their roll.

### Attributes
Your characters aptitude is represented by 6 core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence, Willpower, and Charisma. Each attribute governs a number of skills in addition to the following:

#### Strength
Each point of Strength improves your melee attacks.

#### Dexterity
Each point of Dexterity improves your ranged attacks, attacks with melee weapons with the _finesse_ property, and how far you can sprint.

#### Stamina
Each point of Stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

#### Intelligence
Each point of Intelligence improves your arcane spellcasting ability and the number of spells you can prepare.

#### Willpower
Each point of Willpower improves your occult spellcasting ability.

#### Charisma
Each point of Charisma improves your divine spellcasting ability.


# Proficiency

Proficiency is a measure of how capable your character is at a given skill or task. Every skill, weapon type, spell school, tool, and attribute save have their own proficiency score which can be increased as your character grows. With the exception of spell proficiencies, there is no limit on how many skills you can be proficient in. You may only increase spell proficiencies if you have the appropriate background or feat. Proficiencies cannot go above 5.


### Skills

Skills represent your characters ability to apply themselves in a variety of situations. While your attributes determine your raw talent in a subject, your skills determine how well honed or practiced you are in applying those attributes. For example, a character with high Charisma and low conversation may speak eloquently, but may have trouble focusing those words in a way that gets their point across or convinces others. A dexterous character may be quick on their feet, but lack the experience or muscle memory to be able to swing from a chandelier or jump from table to table.

Each skill has an associated attribute and its own proficiency modifier. There are no restrictions for which skills a player can add proficiency for, however you gain no benefit for proficiency scores above your attribute score.

|                  |   Religion   |

 - **Athlethics** is your ability to focus or exert your strength in a controlled manner. For example, bracing a door, hanging or pulling yourself up from a ledge, or leaping a great height or distance.
 - **Acrobatics** determines how controlled or accurate your body movements are. For example, moving over ice without slipping, swinging from a rope and landing on your feet, or balancing on a moving cart without falling.
 - **Arcana** is your understanding of magic and your ability to sense it. Someone skilled in arcana can sense the presence of magic or its source, determine its properties, or recall information about a particular spell.
 - **Conversation** determines your ability to easily convey information and sway others with your words. Conversation covers a wide variety of social aspects, from bargaining with a shopkeeper for a better deal, picking up on the undertones and hidden meaning of anothers words, to proper etiquitte when dealing with nobles and lords.
 - **Exhaustion** is your talent to resist fatigue and push your bodies limits. For example, staying awake through the night, travelling a great distance without rest, or holding your breath.
 - **Insight** is your ability to gain intuitions about a person or object. A character with high insight can read the body language of another person, seeing the smallest cracks in their demeanor that betrays their true intentions. Insight is also your ability to understand an objects purpose and how easily you can draw connections between pieces of information. For example, a character exmaining a murder scene may deduce the dagger found at the scene of the crime belonged to the victim instead of the killer.
 - **Intimidation** determines your ability to present yourself in a threatening manor and coerce others. An intimidating character knows the best way to loom over others, instill fear with just a stare, or how to apply just the right amount of force to get what they want.
 - **Lore** is your ability to recall history, folklore, and your ability to decipher ancient runes or text. Characters skilled in lore have great attention to detail and use this knowledge when identifying the properties of magic items. Lore may be used when attempting to determine the age of a structure or the culture that built it, gleaning information from an assortment of texts, or translating and communicating with a creature that speaks a language you don't know.
 - **Medicine** determines both your abiltiy to apply medicine and your knowledge of poisons, illnesses, and anatomy. For example, a character proficient in medicine can carefully stitch wounds to avoid infection, diagnose a variety of diseases and their cures, or can recall the specific anatomy of a multitude of creatures.
 - **Nature** is your compentency with the natural world, both your understanding of it and your ability to control and manipulate it. For example, being able to calm or befriend wild animals, ride all manor of beast, or identify and recall information about plants, trees, or environments.
 - **Perception** is how well your character can sense their surroundings. Perception is not limited to sight, with perceptive characters able to hear a pin drop on a noisy street or feel the faint vibrations of someone sneaking up behind them. A character may use perception to search a room for clues, traps, or hidden doors, spot a hidden or invisible creature, or listen in on a conversation through a wall.
 - **Performance** is your characters ability to act, sing, dance, or play an instrument. A character might use performance to mimic another persons voice and mannerisms, play an instrument to charm local tavern-goers, or disguise themselves to look like someone or something else.
 - **Religion** is your characters attunement to the divine weave. Characters skilled in religion are able to remember and recite religious texts, perform religious ceremonies, or commune with celestial spirits or deities.
 - **Stealth** determines your ability to move undetected and hide your presence. Characters may use stealth to avoid being detected by the town guard, blend in with their surroundings, or disappear into a crowd.
 - **Survival** is your ability to persist in a harsh environment and orient yourself to prevent getting lost. Characters use survival to patiently lay in wait to hunt animals, find and follow a particular creatures tracks, or find herbs, food, or other ingredients in the wild.
 - **Thievery** is your ability to break into things or use sleight of hand. Characters may use thievery to perform a card trick, disarm a trap, pick a locked door, or take something from a person without them knowing.


### Tools

To use tools you must have at least 1 proficiency score with the tool. Their use is shown in the Items and Equipment chapter.

| Tool             | Attribute    |
| :--------------- | :----------- |
| Repair Kit       | Strength     |
| Apothecary Set   | Willpower    |
| Enchanters Tools | Intelligence |
| Scribing Tools   | Intelligence |

### Expertise

Some feats or abilities grant you expertise in a specific skill or action. When making a roll you have expertise in you may reroll 3 dice, taking the new values.


### Attribute Saves

Every attribute has an associated attribute save. Attribute saves are a measure of how resistant your character is to various effects. Attribute saves are almost always _reactionary_, with your character making the save in response to an action something else takes. For example, someone trying to shove you would make a roll against your Strength save, or dodging a trap would roll against your Dexterity save.

You cannot increase your attribute save's proficiency directly, instead it is based on the total proficiency score of all skills under that attribute. Your attribute save proficiency is equal to the sum of all skill profficiencies for that attribute divided by 2, rounded down. For example, a character with 2 acrobatics and 1 stealth proficiency would have a dexterity save proficiency of 1.

### Spell Schools

There are 3 schools of magic: arcane, occult, and divine. Each school uses its own proficiency score and you must be trained in the spell school before you can add to them. Training can come from background feats, basic feats, or during character creation.

### Weapons

Weapons are split between simple and proficient weapons. Simple weapons can be used by anyone and don't use their own proficiency modifier. Instead you use the relevant weapon proficiency. When using a proficient weapon that you don't have a related weapon proficiency with you add 1 terrible die to the attack roll.

Weapon proficiencies are split between 4 categories: One Handed, Two Handed, Ranged, and Unarmed. By default melee weapons and unarmed use Strength while ranged weapons use Dexterity, but this can changed based on the weapon. For example a weapon with the _finesse_ modifier can use Dexterity for its attribute, while weapons with _Thrown_ can use Strength when used as a ranged weapon.

# Spells


Spells are split into 3 schools of magic: arcane, occult, and divine. Each school handles a different type of magic and uses a different attribute for its spellcasting. Arcane spells use the elements and raw power to defeat their foes, using Intelligence for its attribute. Occult spells inflict curses and maladies to their targets and uses Willpower. Divine spells center around healing and empowering targets and uses Charisma.

To cast a spell you must have a codex containing the spell you want to cast, have the spell prepared, and have enough mana to cast the spell.

### Codexes

Very few creatures are able to innately cast magic. Almost everyone must prepare spells they've written into a spell book, or codex. There is no limit on the school, level, or type of spell you can hold in your codex. New spells can be added to your codex by copying spells from spell scrolls or a codex. This process is destructive, and destroys the scroll or codex after a spell is copied.


>**Variant Rule - Spells from Codexes**
>
>In some games spells may be limited, or codexes a rare occurrence. With this variant when copying a spell from a codex, instead of destroying the codex you make an arcana check against 2 bad dice. On success the codex is not destroyed. Copying a spell removes the spell from the codex.

### Mana

Casting spells of 1st level and above takes a toll on the caster. A character can only cast so many of these spells before needing to rest. Mana is a representation of your characters magical energy and how efficiently they are able to channel that energy. When casting a spell at 1st level or above you expend an amount of mana according to the following table:

| Spell Level |    Mana     |
| :---------: | :---------: |
|   1st-4th   | Spell level |
|     5th     |      6      |
|     6th     |      8      |
|     7th     |     10      |
|     8th     |     13      |
|     9th     |     16      |
|    10th     |     20      |



### Spell Power

Spell power determines how attuned your body is to spellcasting and how efficiently you can use mana, or magical energy. A characters maximum mana is based on their Spell Power according to the following table:

| Spell Power | Maximum Mana |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|      1      |      3       |
|      2      |      7       |
|      3      |      12      |
|      4      |      19      |
|      5      |      27      |
|      6      |      36      |
|      7      |      48      |
| 8 and Above |     +12      |

### Preparing Spells

Before you can cast a spell from your codex you must prepare it. Each long rest you may prepare 3 cantrips, and 2 spells of your choosing for every point of Intelligence and spell power. Having negative Intelligence does not reduce the number of spells you can prepare. Once prepared, spells are castable until the next day even without your codex. The spells fade from your memory over the next long rest unless you prepare them again.

Spells are complex, with each spellcaster having their own methods of writing and remembering spells. Spells prepared from one codex requires a different frame of mind than spells prepared from another. Attempting to unravel spells from multiple codices always ends with failure, thus you may only prepare spells from a single codex each long rest. You can prepare from any codex, however preparing from a codex you have not written must be deciphered first. Deciphering takes 8 hours of work, after which you may prepare from it normally.

### Casting Spells

Each spell has either an AP cost or a time given as its casting time. There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast a turn as long as you have the AP to do so. Casting a spell that lists a time instead of AP can still be used in combat, but requires the casting time worth of full turns. For example casting a spell with a cast time of 1 minute requires 3 full turns to cast. Spells require a spoken incantation to be properly cast. Casting a spell while gagged or otherwise silenced is incredibily difficult, adding 2 terrible dice to the spellcasting rolls.

All spells, including cantrips, can be cast at a higher level to increase its potency. When casting at a higher level you spend mana equal to the level your casting at, not the spells base level. Casting spells this way gives additional effects listed in the spell.

Depending on your character's level you will only be able to cast spells up to a certain level. The table blow shows the maximum level your character can cast based on their level.

| Player Level | Spell Level |
| :----------: | :---------: |
|     1st      |     1st     |
|     3rd      |     2nd     |
|     6th      |     3rd     |
|     9th      |     4th     |
|     12th     |     5th     |
|     15th     |     6th     |
|     18th     |     7th     |
|     21st     |     8th     |
|     24th     |     9th     |
|     27th     |    10th     |


### Concentration

Some spells require concentration to maintain its effects. You may only concentrate on a single spell at a time and casting a new spell with concentration will end the effects of the previous spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell you make a Stamina save against a bad die and adding a terrible die for every wound taken from the attack. On failure you lose concentration and the spell ends.

### Cantrips

Cantrips are spells that do not require mana to cast, but must still be prepared like the rest of your spells. For casting at a higher level, cantrips are considered level 0 spells and gain benefits when cast at 1st level or above.


# Creating a Character

Creating a character is simple. To start, choose a species for your character. The species determines your starting wounds, how far you can move or sprint, and your starting attribute bonuses. Each species has a unique feat that all people of that species share. 

After picking a species, choose a background feat for your character. These are unique feats that can only be chosen during character creation and determine what kind of skills or abilities your character had before becoming an adventurer.

Next, assign your attribute scores. You start with a -1 to all attribute scores, adding any bonuses from your species. You get 9 points you can arrange across your attributes. At this stage characters can have a max attribute score of 3, with 5 being the maximum you can increase an attribute from leveling up.

You have 4 proficiency points to spend on your skills. If you have a background or feat that gives you proficiency in a spell school you may increase your spellcasting proficiency.

Finally, choose 2 starting bonuses.



##### Starting Bonuses
- Increase an attribute score by 1, up to a max of 3
- Get training in a spell school and gain 1 proficiency score in that spell school
- Gain 5 proficiency points
- Learn a feat and gain 1 proficiency score with a skill
- Learn 2 maneuvers and gain 1 proficiency score with a weapon type
- Increase your max wounds by 2
- Increase your spell power by 1 and gain 1 proficiency score with a spell school (if trained) or a skill


>**Variant Rule - Rolling for Attributes**
>
>Instead of using the normal rules for attributes, your group may decide to roll your scores. For each attribute roll 1 superior, 2 normal, and 1 terrible die, adding up the total successes.


>**Variant Rule - Group Rolls**
>
>Many people prefer the randomness given by rolling for attributes, but this can often lead to very powerful or weak characters across a group. As a way to ensure every player is on the same level, each player takes turns rolling an attribute score. Once 6 scores have been rolled the players use those scores to create their characters. The players can place the scores in any attribute they want, but they must use the same 6 scores as every other player.

### Starting Equipment
Depending on your background you may start with additional gear. All players start with an adventuring kit containing a bedroll, 10 days of rations, a fire kit and 50ft of rope. In addition you start with 50 silver crosses which you can spend on adventuring gear. Any unspent silver becomes your characters starting money.

### Leveling Up

When you earn 1000 experience your character levels up. Each level you gain 1 proficiency point and choose one of the following bonuses:

- Gain 1 spell power
- Gain 3 proficiency points
- Gain a feat
- Learn 2 maneuvers
- Increase your max wounds by 1

##### Attribute Score increase

Starting at level 3, every 3 levels you increase an attribute score by 1, up to a max of 5.

##### Action Points

You start with a max of 10 action points, increasing by 1 at levels 10, 20 and 30.

##### Max Wounds Increase

Your max wounds increases by 1 at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

##### Healing Surges

Your max healing surges increases by 1 at levels 10, 20, and 30.

#### Earning Experience
Players earn experience after every encounter based on the difficulty of the encounter. Experience is earned based on how difficult it is for the players to overcome the encounter, not by how much experience an individual monster gives.



##### Encounters
| Difficulty | Experience |     CR level     |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |
|    Easy    |   50-100   | 75% Party Level  |
|  Average   |  100-150   |   Party Level    |
|    Hard    |  150-250   | 125% Party Level |
|   Deadly   |  250-500   | 150% Party Level |


>**Variant - Milestones**
>An alternative to experience is milestones. Experience can in some cases be hard to keep consistent across adventures. With milestones you gain a level after completing an adventure, or at set points during the adventure.


# Adventuring

As an adventurer you'll be spending just as much time travelling to and from the dungeon as you will delving its depths. Even the most battle hardened adventurers need to rest from time to time. Resting comes in two forms: short and long rests. Each day you can take at most two short rests and one long rest. Taking any more than that has no effect.

### Travelling

A normal travelling day is 8 hours, with travel speed varying greatly based on the terrain. You can push yourself to travel for longer at risk of gaining exhaustion. For every extra hour you spend travelling you make an exhaustion roll. Starting against 2 bad dice, you add 1 terrible die every time you make this roll this day. On failure you gain 1 level of exhaustion and cannot travel further.

Travelling with a mount makes travel easier, removing most of the strain of travel. However, while travelling is easier for you, most mounts won't spend more than 8 hours a day in travel. If your mount has the ability to fly you do not take any penalties to travel based on the terrain.

##### Travel Speed
|           |      Type       | Miles per Day |
| :-------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
| _Terrain_ |                 |               |
|           |      Road       |      16       |
|           | Plains, Forest  |      12       |
|           | Mountain, Swamp |       8       |
| _Mounts_  |                 |               |
|           |   Horse, Mule   |      +2       |
|           |    War Horse    |      +4       |
|           |     Exotic      |     +2-8      |

### Short Rests

Short rests require an hour of uninterrupted rest to complete. During a short rest you may spend any number of healing surges to restore lost wounds. You regain mana equal to half your character's level, rounded up, with a minimum of 1. You only get the benefits of a short rest if you are able to complete it. Taking other actions, such as brewing a potion, breaks your rest.



### Long Rests

Long rests require 8 hours of rest with at most 2 hours of non-strenuous activity, such as keeping watch, preparing spells, or brewing potions. You automatically recover 3 healing surges over a long rest, and you may spend any number of healing surges to restore wounds. You regain mana equal to 3 + your character's level, recover 1 point of exhaustion, and end the effect of one minor injury. If you go more than 24 hours without taking a long rest you must make an exhaustion roll against 2 bad dice and 1 terrible die. You make this check every 24 hours without a long rest.

When taking a long rest in the wilderness you must light a fire and make camp to gain the full benefits. To start a fire, make an average difficulty survival check. Depending on your location this roll may be easier or harder. On failure, instead of the normal benefits you regain 1 healing surge and restore mana equal to half your character's level. You may still spend any number of healing surges during this rest.

### Exhaustion
All adventurers need to rest from time to time, trying to do too much in a day can leave you exhausted. You can gain exhaustion from many situations, from travelling too long, not taking rests, spells, or abilities. You lose a level of exhaustion after every long rest.

Exhaustion causes incredible strain on a creature, going beyond simply being tired. Exhausted creatures are incapable of reaching their full potential, and are much more likely to succumb to their injuries. Each level of Exhaustion decreases your max wounds and reduces the successes in every roll you make, except with defense rolls. Creatures that have their max wounds reduced to 0 from exhaustion die outright, their bodies pushed beyond the limit they can take. Similarly, any creature that reaches 6 levels of exhaustion dies regardless of remaining wounds.

##### Exhaustion Levels
| Level | Roll Penalty | Max Wounds | Sprint |
| :---: | :----------: | :--------: | :----- |
|   1   |      -1      |     -1     | Yes    |
|   2   |      -1      |     -2     | Yes    |
|   3   |      -2      |     -3     | No     |
|   4   |      -2      |     -4     | No     |
|   5   |      -3      |     -5     | No     |

### Downtime
- optional downtime rules
- Players can only level up 3 times between downtimes
- Players can take a handful of downtime actions:
  - Retraining: move proficiency points between skills/abilities
  - Earn Money: gain money based on their level
  - Find Contacts: learn and meet notable people, get access to an organization or group, learn information
  - Aquire Resources: scout out specific resources, scrolls, or magic items

# Skill Challenges

- 1/3/5 point challenges
- investigative skill challenges
- dangerous skill challenges (eg: deactivating traps, escaping collasping buildings, etc)
- chase skill challenges
- stealth challenges

# Combat

There will be times when combat is unavoidable. Your adventurer may encounter zombies in an underground crypt, or be ambushed by a group of bandits. When this happens every creature participating in combat rolls for initiative. Once initiative order has been set, each creature takes a turn. Once every creature has had a turn the round ends and a new one begins starting with the first creature. Each round lasts 20 seconds.

### Initiative

When combat starts every character and creature in combat rolls for initiative. By default you roll 5 normal dice, replacing 1 with an enhanced die for every point of Dexterity you have. Negative Dexterity converts normal dice to bad dice instead. You add a flat success/failure modifier depending on the circumstances. These values can be changed by feats or skills, and other dice may be added.

Combatants take turns, starting with whoever rolled the highest initiative and ending with whoever rolled the lowest. After every combatant has had a turn the round ends and a new round begins. This repeats until combat is over or one side has defeated all other combatants.

Sometimes the party or monsters may get the drop on the other. A group of monsters may be waiting for the party and ambush them in the next room, or the party may blink into a room of monsters, taking them by surprise. In these cases the first round of combat is a surprise round. Each surprised creature takes a -3 penalty to their initiative for the first round, using their normal initiative every round after. It's possible that not every character or monster is surprised, and in some cases creatures on both sides can be surprised.



### On your turn

Each turn your action points are refilled. You can spend any amount of AP on your turn and any unused AP can be used on reactions during the rest of the round. You gain no benefit for any unspent AP when your turn comes again.

##### Attack (5 AP)
Make a weapon attack against a creature. The actual damage, range, and effects of an attack depend on the weapon used in the attack. Unarmed attacks use Strength and deal a wound die in damage.

To make an attack you make an attack roll against the creatures defense. If you have more successes than the targets defense you hit, with ties favoring the defender and counting as a miss.

##### Grapple
Instead of making an attack you can attempt to grapple a creature. Make an athletics check, with the target choosing to make either a Dexterity or Strength save. On success you grapple the creature. While grappling a creature your move and sprint speed are reduced to 1 and cannot be increased, however the grappled creature is dragged with you. Anything that changes the AP cost of your attacks also effects grapples. Likewise you may attempt to grapple as many times as you want as long as you have AP and aren't currently grappling anyone.

You may end a grapple at any time. A grappled creature can attempt to free themselves on their turn by spending 5 AP. They make a Strength save against your athletics check, freeing themselves on success.

##### Defend (5 AP)
Until your next turn you reroll 2 dice when making a defense roll and shields give an additional die to defense rolls.

##### Move (3 AP, once per turn)
You may move up to your move speed in tiles. Some terrain, such as difficult terrain, requires 2 tiles of movement for every tile you traverse. Movement does not have be done all at once, you can split your movement as many times as you want. For example if you have a movement of 5 you may move 3 tiles, take another action, and then move the remaining 2 tiles.

##### Sprint (2 AP, can only be used after move, once per turn)
You may move up to your sprint speed plus your Dexterity score in tiles. Negative Dexterity has no effect on your sprint speed. Moving while sprinting follows the same rules as the Move action.

##### Shift (1 AP)
You move a single tile. This movement follows the same rules as the move and sprint actions, and effectively gives 1 additional tile of movement for each shift used during your turn. This movement is effected by difficult terrain, and you may need multiple shifts to move through a tile.

#### Jumping
You may jump as part of any movement action. Characters can easily clear a single tile with their jump, but longer jumps will require an Athletics challenge to successfully land. You do not need to complete your jump on your turn and may end your turn in midair, however your first action on your next turn must be a movement action to complete the jump.

##### Reaction Attack (2 AP)
When a creature tries to leave your zone of control you may make a reaction attack against them. You cannot use maneuvers, unless the maneuver says it can be used as a reaction, and the attack uses the same rules as the Attack action.

##### Off-hand Attack (2 AP, can only be used after an attack, once per attack action)
When dual wielding, as long as you have taken the Attack action you may make an attack with your offhand weapon. This attack is identical to the Attack action, except you do not get any bonus from proficiency.

##### Use (2 AP)
This covers a wide range of actions, from using an item, drinking a potion, activating a magic item, or interacting with an object (e.g. pulling a switch). Some magic items will give their own AP costs, using those instead. While there is no limit in how many times a turn you can take the Use action, some items may have restrictions. A creature can only benefit from a single potion each round.

>**Variant Rule: Using Potions on Others**
>You can use potions on downed creatures by spending 5 AP instead of 2. Normal potion rules still apply.

#### Switch Weapon (2 AP)
When carrying weapons, tomes, or shields, unless you are storing them in your pack it is assumed they are visible on your character, ready to use at a moments notice. At the start of your turn you may swap one of the items you are holding with another one of your visible items. For example, putting away your shield and unsheathing a dagger. When done as the first thing on your turn this action is free and does not cost AP.

You may switch a weapon or shield for another visible weapon or shield during your turn by spending 2 AP. For example, switching to a sword after taking a shot with a bow costs 2 AP while switching to a sword immediately at the start of your turn is free.

##### Spell (Varying AP)
There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast each turn, as long as you have enough AP to cast them. Spells will require you to make a Spellcasting roll against the creatures defense or attribute save, with ties going in favor of the defender.


##### Maneuver (Varying AP)
Maneuvers are special attacks, actions, or reactions your character can learn. You may only use a single maneuver on your turn, and you cannot use the same maneuver two rounds in a row.

##### Ready Action (Varying AP)
There are times you may want to hold your action, waiting for a specific circumstance before you take that action. At any point in your turn you may ready an action. You may only ready a single action and must pay the AP cost for the action immediately. For example, you could ready the _Attack_ action but not both the _Attack_ and _Move_ actions.

To ready an action you must first describe the circumstance that will trigger the action. This can be anything your character can perceive, such as "I want to attack if a goblin moves closer to me" or "I want to cast this spell when an enemy rounds that corner." You must also specify which action you want to take and must have enough AP remaining to take that action. If the circumstance did not happen before your next turn starts you lose the action.

Sometimes more than one readied action could be triggered by the same circumstance. In this case the actions occur in initiative order.

## Conditions
There are a number of conditions that can be inflicted on creatures, each with different effects. Some conditions have a level to determine their potency. For example, the poison condition normally adds a bad die to your attack rolls and attribute saves, where poison 2 and poison 3 adds 2 and 3 bad dice respectively.

##### Blind
A blinded creature loses the ability to see. While blind they add 2 terrible die to all single target attacks, maneuvers and spells, and Dexterity saves. They cannot make reactions.

##### Burn
A burning creature takes a wound die in fire damage at the end of their turn for every level of burn. On their turn a creature can spend 5 AP putting out the fire, leaving them prone. Burn ends after 1 minute or after the creature is doused in water.

##### Charm
a charmed creature treats the source of their charm as a close friend and ally. Charmed creatures may have additional effects depending on the source of the charm, such as obeying their commands, or are prevented from taking certain actions.

##### Dazed
A dazed creature cannot take the Sprint or Reaction actions and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Fear
a feared creature cannot willingly move closer to the source of the fear. While the source is within line of sight, they add 1 bad die to any rolls made.

##### Grapple
A grappled creature cannot move or sprint, adds 2 bad dice to Dexterity saves, and grants combat advantage to all creatures except the grappler.

##### Hex
When making a roll, a hexed creature removes a critical for every level of hex affecting them. If there are no criticals to remove in their roll, criticals are added to the opponents roll instead.

##### Incapacitated
An incapacitated creature takes no actions and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saves. While incapacitated they grant combat advantage to adjacent attackers, and attacks and maneuvers that deal physical damage deal an extra wound die per critical against them.

##### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature cannot take the sprint action, adds a terrible die to all reactions, and has their maximum AP reduced by 3 for each level of Paralyze. They may still take an action that costs more than their maximum AP as long as it is the only action they take during their turn.

##### Poison
A poisoned creature adds a bad die to all attacks, attribute saves, and ability checks, adding an additional bad die for every level of poison. Only the highest level poison takes effect. For example someone who has poison and poison 2 only adds 2 bad dice instead of 3.

##### Possession
A possessed creature is one that is under the direct control of another creature. They are unable to take actions themselves, instead all actions are dictated by the creature possessing them.

##### Prone
a prone creature grants combat advantage to any melee attacker. Ranged attacks against this creature add 2 bad dice to their roll.

##### Restrained
A restrained creature cannot move or sprint and adds 2 terrible dice to Dexterity saves, attacks, and spells. They lose the effects of a shield if wearing one and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Silenced
A silenced creature cannot speak and adds 2 terrible dice to spellcasting rolls.

##### Sleep
A sleeping creature is incapacitated for as long as they are sleeping. A sleeping creature wakes up after being hit by an attack, maneuver, or spell, another creature spends 5 AP waking them, or they hear a loud noise.

##### Slowed
A slowed creature's move and sprint speeds are reduced by 1. Each level of slow reduces the value by 1, to a minimum of 1.

##### Stagger
A staggered creature is unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn.

##### Stunned
A stunned creature cannot take reactions and may only take a single move or basic attack action on their turn. They automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saves and attackers gain combat advantage against them.

##### Weaken
When a weakened creature hits with any attack or maneuver, all wounds are replaced with wound dice.

# The Gameboard

Most GM's use a gameboard when your adventurers are exploring a dungeon or fighting monsters. It can be difficult for players to visualize combat and see what choices they have without one. This rule book assumes you play with a square or hex grid along with miniatures or tokens. If you don't use a grid or use _theatre of the mind_ for your combat your GM may need to adjust or homebrew some of the rules in this section.

### The Tile Grid

The game world uses a square or hex tile grid with each tile representing a 5x5 foot area. Each creature takes up a number of tiles based on their size, which in the case of your adventurers is a single tile. For simplicities sake when determining movement or ability ranges on a square grid we assume that distance is _non-Euclidean_. Basically all this means is travelling to a square diagonal to you costs the same amount of movement as moving to a square orthogonal to you. Hex grids do a much better job at handling movement in all directions, but it can be hard to find resources that support hex grids.


>##### Variant Rule - No Diagonal Movement
>
>Another way to deal with diagonal movement costs is to prevent diagonal movement entirely. This essentially means that travelling diagonally costs 2 tiles worth of movement. If you do use this variant rule, make sure you calculate ranged attacks using the same method, taking 2 'range' to target someone on a diagonal.

### Creatures

Each creature is represented by a miniature or token on the gameboard. Creatures come in all different shapes and sizes, with each size taking up more or less of the board.

|    Size    | Tile's Occupied |
| :--------: | :-------------- |
|    Tiny    | 1/4th           |
|   Small    | 1               |
|   Medium   | 1               |
|   Large    | 2x2             |
|    Huge    | 3x3             |
| Gargantuan | 4x4+            |



#### Movement
All creatures move and sprint speeds are listed in tiles. Any time a creature takes the move or sprint actions they can move up to that many tiles. When moving you may move through allies, but not through hostile creatures. If your movement takes you out of a hostile creatures zone of control they may make an opportunity attack against you.

#### Mounts
You may ride a willing creature as a mount as long as they are capable of carrying you. When mounted both creatures spend AP to take the move and sprint actions, and you may use these actions on either of the creatures turns. While mounted, moving through allied units counts as difficult terrain and while sprinting you cannot move through allies at all.

#### Flying
Creatures that are able to fly can use their movement to move vertically, following the same rules as normal movement. Unless the creature is able to hover, any effect that reduces their movement speed to 0, grapples, restrains, or knocks them prone causes them to fall from the air. 

#### Falling
Falling creatures fall 10 tiles per round, increasing the amount by 10 for each round they spend falling. On hitting the ground or a solid object after falling 5 or more tiles they take 1/1 in bludgeoning damage for every 5 tiles they fell.

#### Prone and Crawling
A prone creature grants combat advantage to all melee attackers, with ranged attacks adding 2 bad dice to their roll instead. A creature that is prone can crawl, spending an extra tile of movement for every tile travelled. Unless the creature has a move speed of 0 they can stand up by spending half of their move speed, rounded down.

#### Zone of Control
A creatures zone of control is a representation of the area they threaten in combat. A creatures zone of control is determined by his weapons reach. For most weapons this covers the 5 adjacent tiles to the creature centered on the direction the creature is facing. If a creature is using a weapon with _Reach_ their zone of control is increased by the same amount. You may enter a creatures zone of control without penalty, but attempting to move out of a creatures zone of control allows them to make an opportunity attack against you. The 3 tiles behind a creature are not part of its zone of control and so do not provoke opportunity attacks.


>**Variant Rule - Ignore Creature Facing**
>Sometimes tracking the direction a creature is facing can be difficult or slow down the game. When using this variant rule a creatures zone of control covers all tiles adjacent to the creature. If you play with flanking rules you can consider a creature as flanked if it has two hostile creatures adjacent to it with at least 1 tile of space between them.



>**Variant Rule - Flanking**
>When a creature is attacked by a melee attack from an attacker that is not in its zone of control the attacker is considered to be flanking that creature. Any attacks made while flanking a creature add 1 critical to their roll.


>**Variant Rule - Ranged Attack Disadvantage**
>With this variant any creature that tries to make a ranged attack, maneuver, or spell attack while another creature is adjacent to them adds 1 terrible die to their roll.

### Hazards and Terrain
Creatures are not the only thing on the battle field. Depending on the location there could be a deep river that inhibits movement, a trap that fires poison darts, a pit of bubbling acid, or even plain old darkness. Regardless of the location these hazards have an effect on your adventurers, and the clever ones can use them to their advantage.

#### Difficult Terrain
Deep water, thick brush, or a rubble filled room could be considered difficult terrain. When moving over difficult terrain every tile of movement costs an extra tile. For example, to move through a deep river 2 tiles wide you need to spend 4 tiles of movement. Climbing a wall or rock face also takes an extra tile of movement, with a difficult to climb wall taking 3 tiles of movement for every 1 tile climbed.

#### Traps and Hazards
Dungeons may be filled with traps or other hazards. Traps may be hidden, triggered only by a careless step or trip of a wire. Other hazards are blatantly obvious, like a pool of lava or ominous pit. While the exact mechanics of a trap or hazard is left up to the GM, characters can attempt to search or spot traps around them. Characters that succeed on a perception challenge may spot a trap or understand how it's triggered.

Hazards, such as a pool of lava or acid, are more obvious. Creatures that enter those tiles take damage immediately, taking damage again at the end of their turn for as long as they are in the hazard. A creature doesn't need to willingly move into a hazard to be affected by it. Characters can shove or push other creatures, or cast spells that knock creatures back.

#### Darkness
Most creatures are unable to see in the dark and struggle to see creatures in dim light. When making a single target attack, maneuver, spell attack, or when trying to detect a creature in darkness you add 2 terrible dice to your roll, or 1 terrible die if they are in dim light. If a creature has a free hand they can light a torch, covering a 3 tile area around the creature in bright light and a further 3 tiles in dim light.



#### Cover
Some terrain can be used as cover, protecting creatures from attacks. Anything that obscures the creature or is large enough to hide behind can be used as cover, such as a stone fence, pillar, tree, or overturned table. The benefit you gain depends on the size of the cover and how well it could reasonably defend you against attacks. A creature that is fully behind cover, for example being behind a wall, are untargetable by most attacks. When the target of an attack, maneuver, or spell attack that targets your defense you add dice based on the table below:

|   Cover    | Bonus                    |
| :--------: | :----------------------- |
|  Quarter   | +1 superior defense die  |
|    Half    | +2 superior defense dice |
| 3 Quarters | +3 superior defense dice |
|    Full    | untargetable             |

#### Underwater Hazards
Some dungeons may be submerged, or your adventures may take you to the depths of the sea. Creatures that do not have a swim speed or some method of moving underwater treat all underwater tiles as difficult terrain. Similarly, creatures that cannot breath underwater can only hold their breath for a limited time. A creature can hold their breath for 1 minute, adding a minute for each point of Stamina while not in combat. The exertion of combat greatly limits the time you can hold your breath, with creatures able to hold it for 1 turn, adding a turn for each point of Stamina.

For every minute, or turn in combat, a creature goes beyond their limit they make an exhaustion check against 2 terrible dice and 1 bad die. On failure they gain a level of exhaustion.


### Attack Types
Maneuvers and spells come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Some might target a single creature, while others target an area. Depending on the description these attacks use one of the following areas.

##### Area of Control
When used by a maneuver this attack hits all creatures inside your zone of control. If your zone of control is extended by a weapon with _Reach_ then this attack's area is also extended. Spells that target your area of control, unless otherwise specified, do not benefit from _Reach_.

##### Line
Line attacks hit all creatures in a line extending outward from the attacker. This line doesn't need to follow the grid exactly and can be any direction you wish. A good rule of thumb is if the line crosses more than 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

##### Area
Area attacks hit all creatures in a square or rectangular shape centered on a tile. The spell or attack determines the size of the area. For example, the spell _Fireball_ hits all creatures in a 5x5 tile area. Spells that effect all creatures in a radius use this type, creating a square centered on a point with the given radius.

##### Diamond
Diamond patterns are similar to area attacks, but rotated 45 degrees. Diamond patterns will usually have a size before them, for example a 3 tile diamond would have a size of 3. To determine if a creature is inside a diamond pattern, first make a horizontal and vertical line of tiles based on the dimaonds size, centered on the target of the attack. Then draw a line connecting each of the ends of the lines, if a tile is entirely inside the line they are hit by the attack.

##### Touch
Touch attacks require you to be adjacent to the target, or have their effects begin in an adjacent tile.

##### Cone
Cone attacks are given as a length and width. The cone starts centered along the width, only effecting the center tile. The cone expands as you go down the length of the attack, reaching its width at the end. If the cone covers at least 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

### Damage Types
Damage can come from a variety of sources, such as the swing of a sword, an explosion of magic, or a deadly trap. Regardless of how it's inflicted, damage always falls into one of 3 categories: physical damage, elemental damage, and ethereal damage.

##### Physical Damage
The majority of physical damage comes from weapons. From the stab of a spear, swing of a sword, or impact of a hammer, physical damage covers 3 types:


- **Bludgeoning:** Impact from a weapon or heavy object.
- **Slashing:** The cut of a blade or trap.
- **Piercing:** The stab of a spear or puncture from an arrow.

##### Elemental Damage
The burn of a fire, chill of an intense cold, or a strike of lightning all fall under elemental damage. Most spells that deal damage deal one of the following damage types:


- **Fire:** The burn of a fire or explosion.
- **Cold:** The chill of winter or a frigid blast of wind.
- **Lightning:** The shock of lightning
- **Thunder:** Loud sounds, shockwaves, or blasts of air.
- **Poison:** Deadly poisons, acids, and other diseases.
- **Force:** The raw magical force inflicted by some spells.



##### Ethereal Damage
Ethereal damage directly effects a creatures body and soul. Draining life, causing something to decay, destroying somethings form, or smiting a creature are all examples of Ethereal damage. Ethereal damage covers 3 types:


- **Death:** Draining life or unnatural decay.
- **Holy:** smiting a creature or attacking their spirit.
- **Psychic:** causing madness or deteriorating the mind.


## Items and Equipment

### Currency
Currency in Farhome is divided into 3 types: the copper trite, silver cross, and platinum talent. A silver cross is worth 100 copper trites, and a platinum talent is worth 100 silver crosses.

### Adventuring Gear
Most towns and some villages will have adventuring gear for sale. While the actual costs are determined by the GM, this list can be used to give guidelines for the costs of typical gear adventurers will need.

|         Item         | Cost       |

#### Alembic
A small, portable Alembic for potion making. When making an Apothecary roll you may reroll 1 die.

#### Ammunition
A standard quiver can hold 25 arrows or bolts. Arrows add 0/1 in damage, while bolts only deal the base crossbow damage.

#### Antidote
A vial of antidote used to treat common poisons. You may spend 2 AP to drink the antidote, curing Poison. This does not work against Poisons of level 2 or higher.

#### Bandage
Simple cloth bandages used to cover wounds. During a long or short rest you may use a bandage to reroll a healing surge.

#### Bear Trap
A metal floor trap used to immoblize large creatures. The trap takes 5 minutes to set up and covers a single tile, making a raw Dexterity or Intelligence roll to determine how well it's hidden. A creature attempting to see the trap makes a Survival or Perception check against your roll, seeing the trap on success.

When a large or medium creature steps on the trap they make a Dexterity save against 4 enhanced dice. On hit they are grappled and take 1/1 in piercing damage. They or another creature can spend 5 AP to make a Strength save against 4 enhanced dice, freeing themselves on success.

#### Black Resin
A long burning resin made from tar. When ignited, the resin burns for 1 hour, slowly filling a 10x10 tile area (or nearest 100 tiles) with a thick, black smoke. A creature that enters or ends their turn in the smoke this round makes a Stamina save against 3 enhanced dice. A creature that fails this save 3 times over a 2 minute period becomes incapacitated, waking within an hour after the smoke clears.

#### Caltrops
A sack of caltrops, enough to cover 2 tiles. By spending 5 AP you spread caltrops in 2 adjacent tiles. The Caltrops count as difficult terrain and any creature that falls into the caltrops, either by falling or being knocked prone, takes 1/0 in piercing damage.

#### Etching Acid
A small vial of acid used to engrave metal. When making an Enchanting or Inscription roll you may reroll 1 die, consuming the acid. You may also use the acid to melt a small amount of metal. For example, it can be used on the hinges of a door to fuse them together, barring the door.

#### Fire Kit
Contains kindling and equipment to easily start a campfire. Can be used to pass a survival check when building a fire. Has 10 uses.

#### Grapple Hook
A metal hook attached to 50 ft of rope. Used in place of an attack action, make a ranged attack using Strength or Dexterity targeting a point within 10 tiles. The GM adds challenge dice depending on the distance and the surface hooked. On success the hook lodges firmly, able to hold 1000 lbs of weight before breaking.

#### Healers Kit
A small pack containing banadages, ointments, and other materials used to patch up small injuries. You may spend 1 minute tending to yours or another creatures wounds. The creature may spend a healing surge, healing for the amount rolled. Each kit has 5 uses.

#### Linseed Oil
A small jar of linseed oil, used to maintain weapons and armor. When making a Repair roll you may reroll 1 die. 5 uses.

#### Net
A net made of rope, leather, or twined fibers used to catch a medium or smaller creature. Used in place of the attack action, make a ranged attack using Strength or Dexterity against a creature within 2 tiles. The creature makes a Dexterity save against the attack, being grappled on hit.

Once grappled, the creature can spend 5 AP on their turn making a Strength save against 5 Enhanced dice, freeing themselves and destroying the net on success. Another creature can free the grappled creature by spending 1 turn cutting through the net with an edged weapon, or 1 minute untangling the net.

The net must be properly bundled before being thrown again, reqeuiring 5 minutes of work.

**Banded Net:** A net reinforced with metal. Adds 1 Bad die to your attack rolls with the net. The grappled creature makes a Strength save against 5 Superior dice instead of Enhanced, and attempting to cut the net requires a successful attack roll against 3 Superior Defense dice.

**Barbed Net:** Adding barbs to the next causes it to deal 0/1 in piercing damage on hit and every time the grappled creature attempts a Strength save to free themselves from the net.


**Enchanted Net:** A net made with enchanted rope that seeks out its target. You may target creatures up to 5 tiles away and add 1 Superior die to your attack roll.

#### Smoke Pellet
Small beads that when thrown create an area of obscuring smoke. You may spend 2 AP to throw the pellet up to 5 tiles, exploding in a cloud of smoke covering a 3x3 tile area centered on the impact.

**Black Powder Pellet:** Creates a cloud of flammable black powder when thrown. Any fire in the 3x3 tile area, such as a torch or the flaming projectile of a spell like _Firebolt_ causes it to ignite. All creatures make a Dexterity save against 4 enhanced dice, taking 1/1 in fire damage on fail.

#### Prayer Chalk
Chalk made from bones purified by a priest. You may spend 1 minute per tile etching holy wards and inscriptions. For the next day undead treat the inscriptions as difficult terrain and any undead that pass over the inscriptions add 1 bad die to all attacks and attribute saves for the next minute.

Each piece of chalk can cover 10 tiles.

#### Rope
A bundle of rope 50 ft long. A creature bound by the rope can attempt to break free once every hour by making a Strength save against 5 enhanced dice. On success the rope breaks.

**Banded Rope:** Rope reinforced with metal. Attempting to break the rope uses 5 Superior dice for the Strength save.

**Chain:** A metal chain 10 ft long. Attempting to break the chain uses 7 Superior dice for the Strength save.

#### Snare
Contains everything needed to make a simple snare trap. The snare takes 5 minutes to set up and covers a single tile, making a raw Dexterity or Intelligence roll to determine how well it's hidden. A creature attempting to see the trap makes a Survival or Perception check against your roll, seeing the trap on success.

When triggered by a large or smaller creature they are grappled and knocked prone. The creature or an ally can spend 5 AP to cut the snare, freeing them and destroying the trap.

#### Torch
You can spend 5 AP to light the torch. Torches emit bright light out 3 tiles and dim light a further 3. Once lit a torch will last for 1 hour.

#### Whistle
A simple whistle made out of wood. You may spend 2 AP to blow the whistle which is audible up to 60 tiles away.

### Potions and Poisons
Potions and poisons are valuable tools for any adventurer. It's common for an adventurer to carry a few healing potions for difficult situations or to revive an unconscious party member. While basic healing potions are common enough that you can find them in most towns, adventurers have to make due with whatever potions they find or brew themselves. Due to the magical nature of ingredients used in brwing potions an unopened potion can last hundreds of years without spoiling.

With the ever-present danger of living in Farhome even the smallest villages keep a healing potion on hand, although adventurers may find it difficult to get them to part with it. Towns large enough for a herbalist will have a few for sale in their stores, while the large cities carry a wide range of potions. Poisons, being less useful to the common villager, are much harder to find for sale.

Using a potion or poison requires a Use action (2 AP) and consumes the item when used. The magical potentency of potions make it impossible to metabolize more than one each round. Potions can be used on onconscious creatures, costing 5 AP instead of 2. Poisons can be used to coat an edged weapon or applied to ammunition. A poison vial contains enough poison to coat a single weapon or 4 pieces of ammunition. Poisons lose their potency after 2 attacks with a weapon or after the ammunition has been fired.

|           Item            | Cost     |

### Spell Scrolls
Attempting to transfer a spell from one codex to another is a difficult process, and can often destroy the codex in the process. Instead, spells are written from memory onto scrolls. Writing scrolls requires a variety of rare and magical components and the act of copying a scroll into a codex destroys the scroll. Still, it is by far the easiest way wizards teach others spells. Spell scrolls are written in a magical language, allowing them to be understood by anyone regardless of the language of the writer.

Spell scrolls can be found for sale all over Farhome, with most towns and cities having wizards practicing their craft. While lower level spells are plentiful, finding higher level spell scrolls for sale may be difficult or downright impossible.

### Weapons
There are 2 types of weapons: simple, and proficient. Simple weapons are usable by anyone, even those without training. Proficient weapons require at least one point of proficiency into a related weapon proficiency to wield properly. Someone who uses a proficient weapon without having the proficiency for it adds a terrible die to all rolls made with that weapon. For example, to use a sword effectively you need at least 1 proficiency with one handed weapons, or to use a bow you need at least 1 proficiency in ranged weapons.

#### Weapon Modifiers
Aside from the damage they deal, each weapon has modifiers that change how that weapon can be used. Without modifiers, weapons are considered one handed melee weapons that use Strength for their attack rolls. 

##### Heavy
This weapon is extremely heavy. Attacks and maneuvers made with this weapon add 2 AP to their cost.

##### Finesse
This weapon can use either Strength or Dexterity for attack rolls.

##### Loading
This weapon can only be used to attack once per round.

##### Range
This weapon can attack at range using your Dexterity score for the attack roll. Range is followed by two numbers, the near and far range. Attacks made inside the near range attack as normal while attacks within the far range add a terrible die to the attack roll.

##### Reach
This weapon can attack creatures 1 tile further and their zone of control extends an additional tile.

##### Resistance
You reduce the number of wounds dealt by the level of resistance. For example, _Fire Resistance 1_ reduces all wounds taken from fire damage by 1.

##### Thrown
This weapon can be thrown using the ranged weapon proficiency instead. You may use either Strength or Dexterity for the roll. Thrown is followed by two numbers, the near and far range. Attacks made inside the near range attack as normal while attacks made within the far range add a terrible die to the attack roll.

##### Two-Handed
This weapon requires both hands to use.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with two hands, using your two-handed proficiency. When used this way roll additional wound dice equal to the Versatile level.

##### Vulnerable
You increase the number of wounds dealt by the level of vulnerability. For example, _Bludgeoning Vulnerability 1_ increases the wounds taken by bludgeoning attacks by 1. If the attack can do damage, but didn't (due to rolling wound dice) a Vulnerable creature still takes the extra damage.

##### Unarmed
This weapon is used with unarmed attacks. Unarmed weapons require both hands and cannot be used with a shield. Unarmed weapons count as dual wielding for offhand attacks.

### Armor
There are 3 types of armor: light, medium, and heavy. There is no proficiency required to wear armor, but different armors give different penalties. Medium armor adds a bad die to all Dexterity saves, stealth checks, and spellcasting rolls. Heavy armor adds a terrible die to all Dexterity saves, stealth checks, and spellcasting rolls.

If you do not meet the Strength requirement for wearing your armor you add 1 terrible die to all attacks, maneuvers, attribute saves and spellcasting rolls.

| Armor                                          | Defense | Strength |     Cost | Dex/Spell Penalty |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-----: | :------: | -------: | :---------------: |
| *Light*                                        |         |          |          |                   |

### Ammunition
To use a ranged weapon you need to carry ammunition usable by that weapon. Bows require arrows to fire while crossbows use bolts. Like weapons, ammunition can be enchanted with magic. When using magic ammunition you deal an additional 0/1 in damage for each bonus modifier on the ammunition. For example, a magic arrow with a +1 modifier deals 1/2 piercing damage on hit. Magic ammunition is spent when the attack is made, becoming mundane after the attack.

Towns and cities are often large enough to house an enchanter selling magic ammunition. While +1 varieties are common, it is exceedingly rare to find stronger ammunition for sale.

|    Spell Level     | Cost       | Bonus Damage |
| :----------------: | :--------- | :----------: |
| Mundane Ammunition | 1sc per 25 |      -       |
|   Ammunition +1    | 25sc per 3 | 0/1  |
|   Ammunition +2    | 25sc       | 0/2 |
|   Ammunition +3    | 1pt        | 0/3 |

### Tools

#### Lockpicks

A set of tools for picking a variety of locks. Anyone can use a lockpicking set, but only people with at least 1 proficiency in thievery get the bonuses. Lockpicks come in several rarities.

|     Type     | Bonus                                                                                                   |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    Basic     | None                                                                                                    |
|    Expert    | Adds an enhanced die                                                                                    |
|  Masterwork  | Adds 2 enhanced dice                                                                                    |
| Skeleton Key | Adds 4 superior dice. After the thievery roll, roll a terrible die. The skeleton key breaks on a Disaster. |

#### Repair Kit
Any damage taken by your armor or weapons are permanent until repaired. An item that takes enough damage, whether it's magical or not, is destroyed. A weapon that goes below a -2 modifier or armor that is reduced to a single defense die is destroyed and can no longer be repaired or used.

A damaged weapon adds 1 bad die for every negative modifier, or reduces the superior dice given from a magic weapon. Damaged armor reduces the number of defense dice given by 1, or reduces the superior defense dice given from magic armor.

You may attempt to repair a piece of equipment over a long rest. Make a repair roll against 2 bad dice. On success the gear is repaired by 1 level, or 2 on a critical. You may attempt to repair magical gear, adding a terrible die for each modifier.

#### Apothecary Set

A portable set of tools required to brew potions over a campfire. During a long rest you may attempt to brew a potion or poison if you have the right ingredients, or you may search your surroundings for ingredients.

To search for ingredients make an average difficulty survival check, increasing or decreasing the difficulty based the abundance of the wilderness. Searching for ingredients takes 1 hour. On success you roll 3 superior dice to determine the ingredient found on the table below. You gain a number of ingredients equal to the successes in your survival check.

#### Potions
Each potion requires a number of ingredients and has their own difficulty dice. When brewing a potion make an apothecary roll against the potions difficulty dice. On success you brew the chosen potion, losing the ingredients on failure.

#### Poisons

#### Enchanters Tools
During a long rest you may attempt to enchant a piece of mundane gear. Enchantments lasts for 3 days and counts as magical equipment for the duration. After the enchantment ends the gear returns to normal. To enchant a piece of gear you must have mana and enchanting supplies available. Make an enchanting roll, adding the difficulty dice for the enchantment. On success you make the enchantment, otherwise losing the supplies on failure. Most cities and towns will sell enchanting supplies.
  
You may spend additional mana to improve your roll, adding an enhanced die for every 2 mana spent. Ammunition enchantments are permanent, lasting until the ammunition is used.

#### Scribing Tools
A set of tools for writing spell scrolls and inscribing runes. During a long rest you may attempt to inscribe a rune or spell scroll. Spell scrolls are written in a way such that anyone is able to learn it and add it to their codex. Runes are consumables that give a variety of one-time effects, from enhancing one of your spells to creating a magical trap. Creating scrolls and runes requires mana and uses a mix of gemstones and enchanting supplies which can be found in most cities and towns.

#### Inscribing Spell Scrolls
You can create a spell scroll for any spell in your codex that you are able to cast. Creating a spell scroll of 3rd level or lower can be done during a long rest, with spells of 4th level and higher taking 1 day of work for each level above 3rd. You must have mana available which is consumed in creating the scroll.

When copying spells from a codex you can instead use your scribing tools to create a spell scroll. Doing so costs a single enchanting supply regardless of spell level, ignoring all other costs for creating spell scrolls. For each spell you want to remove from the codex and turn into a scroll you make a scribing roll against that spell levels difficulty. On success you create a spell scroll for that spell, destroying the codex on failure.

|   9th   |  12   |   10pt gemstone   |    10    | 2B/5T          |

#### Inscribing Runes
You can inscribe a rune during a long rest or with 2 hours of downtime. To inscribe a rune you need to have the required supplies and mana which are consumed in creating the rune. Runes are consumed on use, with some requiring a specific trigger to activate. Unless otherwise stated, runes that augment spells require no AP to use while placing a rune takes 2 AP.

### Magic Items

Magic items give a variety of effects and bonuses. Only some magic items require attunement, and each character can only attune with 3 magic items at a time. While you can carry multiple magic items of the same type, you can only get the benefit of one of them. For example, you cannot get the benefit of a _Cloak of Shadows_ as well as a _Cloak of Water breathing_.

#### Attunement

Some powerful magic items require attunement to use. To attune to a magic item you must spend 10 minutes focusing on it, and can be done during a short or long rest without interrupting the rest. If you are already attuned to 3 magic items you must choose which item to lose attunement to when attuning to a new item.

#### Magic Gear

Magic weapons and armor can come with bonus modifiers from +1 to +3. When making an attack roll with a magic weapon you add superior dice to the roll equal to its bonus modifier. For magic armor you add superior dice to your defense roll equal to its bonus modifer instead. Shields do not have bonus modifiers, but can have additional effects.

#### Identifying Magic Items

Magic items can be identified by a successful lore challenge. Each character can only attempt a lore roll once, if you fail then you must either cast _Identify_ on the item or take it to someone who can appraise it.

You can still use magic items without identifying them, but its bonuses will be unknown to you. If the item requires attunement you only benefit from its bonus modifiers unless stated otherwise.

#### Cursed Items

Some magic items may be cursed, giving its holder a permanent, detrimental effect. There are many ways a cursed item can inflict its curse. Some may happen immediately after attuning to the item, some after a specific trigger, and some can curse just by touching the item. The effects of a curse are unique to the magic item and unless otherwise stated last even if you're no longer attuned to the item.

Curses can be removed by successfully casting _Break Curse_ against a level given in the curses description. The spell automatically fails if you still meet the requirements for gaining the curse. For example, a curse that is granted by attuning to the item cannot be removed while you are still attuned to the item.

#### Gaining Attributes through Items

Some magic items grant bonuses to your attributes. While there is no limit on how much this can increase an attribute, you cannot benefit from two items that give bonuses to the same attribute, instead taking only the larger one.

For example, using a _Cloak of Agility_ granting +1 Dexterity and a _Belt of Elvenkind_ granting +2 Dexterity will only give you +2 Dexterity. You still benefit from the remaining bonuses on those items.

## Optional Rules

### Variant Spellcasting and Misfires
These rules can create powerful spellcasters and exciting scenarios, but as a GM can be difficult to balance.

#### Attribute Based Spell Levels

With this rule, instead of your spell level being determined by your level it is determined by your attribute for a given spell school. Your max spell level for arcane spells is based on your Intelligence, occult spells based on your Willpower, and divine spells based on your Charisma. This means an exceptionally intelligent caster could cast high level spells at an early level- if they have the mana and spell prepared.

Your max spell level is determined on the chart below:

| Attribute Score | Spell Level |
| :-------------: | :---------: |
|    0 or Less    |   Cantrip   |
|        1        |     1st     |
|        2        |     2nd     |
|        3        |   3rd-4th   |
|        4        |   5th-6th   |
|        5        |   7th-8th   |
|       6+        |  9th-10th   |

#### Misfires

While anyone can cast any spell, trying to cast a spell beyond your abilities can lead to a misfire. When casting a spell beyond your ability, either normally or through upcasting a spell, you add 1 terrible die to the spellcasting roll for every rank beyond your ability. If you do not have any remaining successes before contesting with another roll the spell misfires. Roll on the misfire chart to determine the effect.

##### Ability Ranks
| Attribute Score | Spell Levels |
| :-------------: | :----------- |
|        1        | 1st          |
|        2        | 2nd          |
|        3        | 3rd-4th      |
|        4        | 5th-6th      |
|        5        | 7th-8th      |
|       6+        | 9th-10th     |


##### Misfire Chart

Roll 2 bad dice, counting the failures.

| Roll  | Misfire                                                                                                                               |
| :---: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  -4   | Minor injury: Mana leak. Every time you take at least 1 wound you lose 2 mana.                                                        |
|  -3   | Your spell backfires, roll a wound die for every failure from your spellcasting roll, taking damage for every wound rolled. |
|  -2   | Wild magic fills the area around you, you and all creatures within 3 tiles add 1 terrible die to their next roll.                     |
|  -1   | Your flow of magic is interrupted. You add 1 terrible die to all spellcasting rolls for the next minute                               |
|   0   | Minor backlash. You take 0/1 in Force damage                                                                                  |

### Large Battles and Minions
Fighting hordes of monsters can make for a thrilling and challenging battle. For example, the players may be exploring a cave network deep underground when they hear the skittering sound of ratlings in the dark. Suddenly, hordes of ratlings burst out of the shadows, crude weapons drawn, descending on the party from all sides. The ratlings are weak, but make up for it with overwhelming numbers, backing the players into a corner.

An exciting encounter... or would be. While the rules make for great combat, it begins to slow down when there are 3-4 monsters for every player. Rolling multiple attacks against a player, especially from weaker but numerous monsters where only a handful of attacks will hit, can grind the action down to a slog. To prevent the slog we've included these optional rules for large packs of monsters: the Swarm Template and Minions.

#### Swarm Template
This template is best used when you want to throw a horde of weaker, less complicated monsters at a party. For example, a horde of Zombies, Goblins, or Bandits. Swarms combine 4-8 identical monsters into a single unit that becomes weaker the more damage it takes. To create a swarm, take any monster stat block and add the following features.

##### Swarm Tactics
This creature has twice as many wounds. This creature can occupy tiles with enemy creatures, but cannot move through them. This creature is immune to conditions that come from single target attacks or spells.

##### Swarm Fighting
This creature adds a success to all attack and maneuver rolls for every quarter of health remaining, rounding up. When making single target attacks or spells, the attack targets an additional creature in range.

##### Swarm Resistance
Damage from single target attacks, maneuvers, or spells deal half damage, rounded up. While above half health they have expertise in attribute saves.

#### Minions
Minions are weaker, streamlined variants of a monster. Minion stat blocks are identical to the base creature, giving them 1-3 max wounds instead of their normal health. Minions of the same type are grouped together, rolling a single initiative and acting at the same time. Minions only take 2 actions during their turn regardless of AP, and may only take a single reaction. When a minion makes an attack you add 1 success for every other minion of the same type capable of making that attack against the target creature, spending 1 action for all participating minions.

For example, lets say a party is fighting a group of 6 Skeleton minions. On the skeletons turn they all act together. 3 Skeletons surround one party member and attack that character. You make a single skeleton attack, adding 2 successes to the roll. This spends an action on all 3 skeletons, leaving them with 1 action remaining. They attack again, making the same roll and adding 2 successes.

The remaining 3 skeletons are further away and spend 1 action moving into range of another player, using their last action to attack. On the players turn they attempt to flee from the skeletons, provoking an opportunity attack. The 3 skeletons all spend their reaction making an opportunity attack, rolling a single attack roll and adding 2 succeses.

### Animal Companions
Beasts and creatures with -1 or less Intelligence can become animal companions. Finding an animal companion can be challenging, often becoming an adventure on its own. Under normal circumstances a beast is only eligable to become a companion if it meets these conditions:

- They are young or a newborn.
- They are not hostile.
- They have an Intelligence score of -1 or less

A character can attempt to befriend the animal by making a nature check against a challenge determined by the GM. On success you befriend the animal and they become your companion. New animal companions are untrained. They will follow you, but will not obey any commands or participate in combat. By default a character can only have a single animal companion, however this can be changed with feats.

#### Intelligent Companions
In some circumstances your GM may allow you to befriend creatures that do not meet the conditions above. In these circumstances you make either a Nature or Conversation check, GM's choice, with the GM determining the challenge. On success they become your companion as normal, however intelligent creatures may obey your commands without training. These companions still require training to effectively fight along side you. Any untrained companion that enters combat is controlled by your GM and acts independently.

#### Training
Companions can be trained to fight and obey your commands. You may train your companion as a downtime action or during a long rest as long as you take no other actions. For every 7 days spent training you make a nature roll against a terrible die, adding a bad die for every 5 CR the creature has. After 3 successes you bond with your companion, allowing them to fight and be given commands.

Trained creatures gain 1 proficiency to attacks and 2 proficiency to attribute saves. Their max wounds increases based on your level, gaining an extra wound at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

#### Fighting Companions
Animal companions take their actions during your turn. Each turn they may move, sprint, and make a single basic attack with you controlling their actions.

While fighting companions have been trained for combat, they are still animals. While your companion is not at full health you make a nature check at the start of each of your turns. The challenge for this roll is a terrible die, adding a bad die for each adjacent enemy. If the companion is below half health, rounded down, add terrible dice instead. On fail the companion turns feral, spending its turn attacking a random creature in range. If there is no creature in range it moves towards the closest creature and attacks.

#### Advanced Training
Completing an adventure or gaining a level with a companion increases your bond with them, making them more effective in combat. For each adventure completed or level gained you may choose one of the following benefits:

- They make two basic attacks each turn instead of one.
- They learn an attack or maneuver shown on the creatures stat block. You may use this attack or maneuver in place of basic attacks.
- They gain 2 proficiency points.

#### Companion Equipment
Trained companions can be given specially made armor and weapons to aid them in combat. Animal equipment can be enchanted, following the same rules as enchanting character equipment. Animal armor replaces one of their normal defense dice with a superior defense die and animal weapons replace a wound die with a wound for all of their attacks and maneuvers. Animal equipment is expensive, usually requiring a blacksmith to custom fit them to your companion.

| Equipment | Cost (Medium) | Cost (Large) |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :----------: |
|   Armor   |      2pt      |     5pt      |
|  Weapons  |      1pt      |  2pt, 50sc   |

## Running the Game

So far the past 40 pages have been about rules, covering everything from creating characters, their abilities, engaging in combat, and everything inbetween. Normally, this would be the point you can stop reading the rules and jump into your first game, and if you are seasoned table top player this is probably true. However, while you've read plenty of rules there isn't much here on actually running a game. 

If you read the section _What is Farhome?_ it talks about exploring dungeons, encountering dangerous and strange monsters, and thwarting evil villains. While all of this is possible, nothing you've read so far tells you exactly _how_ to do that. You have rules on how to interact with a fantasy world, but before you do that you need a fantasy world to interact with. This is where the Game Master, or GM, comes in. The GM is a player that, instead of playing a character, plays everything that is _not_ a character. They create a world for the players to explore, and then they act as the medium the players use to interact with that world.

This section covers running the game from the Game Master's point of view, and isn't very applicable to players. That being said, there aren't many hard and fast rules ahead. There are many different ways to run a game, or be a Game Master, and you won't find a particular style or method of playing in this chapter. Instead, it will cover the more practical aspects you'll need to be able to start a game: A world to play in, an adventure to venture through, and a baseline for creating encounters in Farhome.

### Playing the Game: Part II

It may sound daunting to be a Game Master, after all a world is a big thing to build before you can even play the game. Thankfully we can use some movie magic to simplify things and focus on the details that matter. A movie set in space won't build and launch a space shuttle to film in space, instead they'll build a handful of sets to film on. Likewise, you don't have to build an entire world to run a game. All you need are the pieces the players will interact with, the handful of sets that encapsulate the adventure.

This can be, and often is, as simple as a village and a dungeon to explore. Sure the village may belong to a nation, and that nation belongs to a world, but those don't need to be anything more than names at this point. The players are focused on this village, and subsequently the nearby dungeon. You might not even need a whole town, merely the places the players are likely to visit: a shop, a tavern, the mayors house, or a blacksmith. What exactly you need to prepare, or what details are relevant depends on two things: the adventure you are guiding the players through, which we will go into later, and the particular group of aventurers in your group.

## World of Farhome

### History
- Time of angels: gods live alongside mortals, the Fallen empire, tlani serve the betrayer gods. Ends with war between gods, the god hunters
- Cataclysm: A great cataclysm befalls the Fallen empire, the gods are killed or sealed away, the rise of the elves.
- The Forest of Time: a long period where elves spread and were the dominant species. Great works of magic, ivory spires, vibrant forests, and minor calamities. Eventually the magic of the elves begins to fade, leading to the Zoranth Empire
- The Zoranth Empire: A collection of human settlements and kingdoms, united under one rule. Expanding across world, first mentions of ascended. Ends with a battle between ascended, the noble class is torn apart and the rulers die. Zoranth empire splits into minor nations.
- The Golden Empire: A few hundred years after the Zoranth Empire, a human nation begins to expand, starting the Golden Empire. The Golden Empire succeeds in taking over the majority of the continent, leaving the Far Wilds.

### Languages

#### Spoken Languages

##### Common
- Common language understood by most speicies in Farhome. Its use is so ubiquitous across human nations that the original human language is no longer spoken.

##### Elvish
- split into 3 categories, High Elf, Wood Elf, Star Elf. High elven and star elven are nearly identical, closer to accents. Wood elven is almost its own language (Valanth).

##### Dwarven
- two variants, high and low dwarvish. Languages are similar, difference in regalness. Low dwarvish is the language of nobility, high dwarvish is more common.

##### Green Tongue
- otherwise known as orcish, or Kol'Dak in native tongue, used by most goblins, orcs, and creatures they commonly interact with. Tlani speak an old variant of green tongue (Quel'ilan) with very little overlap with modern orcish.

##### Lizan
- langauge shared by lizardfolk, drakes, kobolds, and a handful of swamp living creatures. While the core language is similar across all species, each race has their own words and phrases that differ.

##### Sylvani
- Used by fey creatures, has an enchanting flow that is easy to get lost in, especially when singing. You have expertise with performance checks when singing Sylvani, and humanoid species that listen are much less likely to pay attention to anyone but you.

##### Druidic
- language of the druids. Druidic can be understood to an extent by animals. While animals cannot speak it themselves, conversation or nature checks with animals when speaking druidic have expertise.

##### Draconic
- language of dragons, it's nearly impossible for non-dragon species to speak, at least fluently. Draconic words reverberate across the divine weave, making it particularly dangerous for those not fluent in it to speak. Draconic has been known to start small fires, freeze water, and dispell enchantments. Wizards fluent in draconic can use it to channel the elements when casting spells. Spells that deal elemental damage can be prepared and cast in draconic, allowing you to reroll a die in the spellcasting roll. Draconic spells are even more difficult to prepare than normal spells, counting as 2 spells for your prepared spell limit.

##### Celestial
- language of spirits, angels, and divine beings

##### Hadal
- language of demons

#### Written Languages

##### Runic
- all spells are written in runic. Runic is a magically charged writing and can be understood by those with a good sense for magic. Reading runic requires a successful arcana check. The difficulty varies wildly based on the writer, some people's runic is universal, easily understood by anyone. Others are so cryptic that only very talented wizards can decypher them. A person can always read their own runic.

##### Signoric
- A shorthand developed by thieves, spies, and scribes to quickly write down a conversation in the shortest time. Signoric is written with sounds rather than words, meaning it can be used to write any spoken language. The difficulty comes with decoding Signoric as it lacks proper punctuation.

### Species

### Elves

#### High Elf

Like most elves, high elves display an otherworldly grace in all that they do. Often living in ancient, timeless forests, humans see high elves as beautiful and elegant, if not slightly arrogant. High elves stand slightly taller than the average human, ranging from 5 and a half feet to nearly 7 feet. However they are more slender, weighing between 100 to 150 pounds. While their complexion matches humans, their hair encompasses a larger range, from silver-white to deep black. Like all elves they have long, pointed ears.

It is rumored that high elves are descended from the fae, a group of magical and supernatural beings of another realm, seeming to explain their natural affinity with magic. Because of this many of the more mundane or superstitious peoples are wary of high elves, believing them to be responsible for any malady affecting their small villages.

#### Wood Elf

Unlike the timeless, magical forests of the high elves, the wood elves call the savage forests as their home. Wood elves display grace and strength in equal measure, being capable hunters and defenders of their forests. Their complexion tends to take on darker tones compared to their high elf cousins, often taking on a copper hue. Their hair ranges from deep reds to brown and black, but is occasionally blond or silver. They are slightly smaller than high elves, ranging from 5 to 6 feet. While they are still slender compared to humans their life in the forest has hardened their bodies, weighing between 120 to 160 pounds.

Due to their fierce dedication to their homeland, wood elves tend to be mistrustful of others, at least until they determine if they are a threat. Because of this most wood elves tend to stay in their forests, but there are those whose wanderlust takes them to explore the world beyond.

#### Star Elf

Seekers of knowledge, the star elves are nomads by nature. Their long lives allow them to see the world from a different perspective compared to the short lived species who see the star elves as aloof and unempathetic. Star elves are naturally curious, and because of this are gifted conversationalists. They love telling tales just as much as they do hearing them.

They are among the tallest species, averaging 7 feet tall, and also the rarest. They have a blue complexion that tends to fade to a pale white, with purple colorations being rare. Their hair is almost always a silvery blue, with eyes a dark blue or purple. Like other elves they have a slender appearance, weighing between 120 to 180 pounds.

### Goblinoid

#### Half-Orc

While most orcs are filled with an all-consuming lust for battle, there are some born free from their curse. Those that are often seek out neighboring human or elven settlements, resulting in half-orcs. Half-orcs retain much of their parents strength and ferocity, free from bloodlust and tempered by their other half. Because of this half-orcs are widely loved among the fringe villages and settlements of the world.

Half orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet. They tend to have strong, wide jaws with small but noticeable tusks, making it impossible to hid their orcish heritage. Their skin tends to be tinted gray green, and with their towering build they weigh between 200 to 250 pounds. Even with human parents half orcs have short, pointed ears, although those with elven parents tend to be longer. While their hair shares the color of their parents, often times they end up with black hair.

#### Tlani

Often confused for goblins or imps, tlani live far from  the rest of the civilized world, preferring to make their homes high in the mountains or deep under the ground. They are short in stature, rarely standing taller than 4 feet. Like elves they have a strange, unnatural beauty tothem that contrasts with their more bestial features, having long pointed ears, cat-like eyes and pointed teeth. Their complexion ranges from dark greys and blues to black with a white or silver underbelly. Their hair tends to match the color of their skin, but rarely it can be blue, green, or purple. Tlani are light, weighing between 40 and 60 pounds, and maintain a youthful appearance well into their 150s.

Due to their small stature, beast-like appearance and affinity for darkness they are usually called night goblins by humans. Tlani are extremely practical, preferring a logical and efficient solution to their problems leading to others seeing them as cold and amoral.

### Humanoid

#### Fallen

Despite their resemblance, fallen are not demons as some humans claim. They are one of the oldest species to emerge, along with the tlani, but their kind has dwindled, now living among the other peoples with no home of their own. Often seen as outsiders, fallen have relied on their wit and cunning to persevere, relying on their charm to get out of difficult situations.

While at times they can be mistaken for humans, all fallen are born with horns. They are taller on average, standing between 6 to 7 feet tall for males, with females being slightly smaller. Fallen are deceptively strong, and make adept warriors with their keen eyesight and bestial claws. Despite their slim stature, they weigh between 180-250 pounds.

#### Human

Out of all the common species, humans are by far the most numerous. While humans are short lived compared to most, they are tenacious and adaptable, which has allowed them to spread to all corners of the world. Due to this, humans span a variety of cultures and morals, taking in customs and traditions from their neighbors and adapting them to human life.


- **Starting Wounds:** 3
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/2
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 to Any
- **Languages:** Common
- **Lifespan:** 70 years

##### Adaptable

You choose 3 bonuses when creating your character instead of 2.

#### Sylvan

Also known as forestfolk, sylvan make their homes in the gentle forests, meadows, and hills of the world. Like the elves, Sylvan have an affinity with nature, preferring to live in small, rural villages instead of big cities. Naturally cheerful, sylvan recover quickly, be it from a night of boisterous reveling or from the dangers of the forest.

Sylvan are short compared to most, standing 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. Sylvan range from slim, almost child like figures to broad, almost dwarf like bodies. Because of this their weight varies wildly, ranging anywhere from 40 to 100 pounds. While their hair follows the usual shades of red, black and blond, it's not uncommon for some families to have emerald green hair and eyes.

##### Fey Blood

#### Half-Elf

Mistaken for an elf among humans, and a human among elves. Half elves often live in human settlements as many elves do not accept half elves as true elves. Their long lives make it difficult to bond with other humans who see half elves as nonchalant and distant. Regardless their elven grace and human tenacity make them excellent hunters, a welcome trait in many of the human settlements of the world.

Half elves are similar in height to humans, averaging between 5 and 6 feet. Like elves they have pointed ears, but aren't as slender, weighing between 150 and 200 pounds. Their hair and eyes usually take after their human parent, but occasionally they will have the silver hair or copper complexion of their elven side.

- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 to Dexterity
- **Languages:** Common, Elvish
- **Lifespan:** 200 years

##### Elven Heritage

You gain the species feat from one of the Elven species.


### Dwarf

#### Hill Dwarf

Making their homes above ground in the hills around mountains, hill dwarves are experts at harnessing the power of nature. Building complex contraptions, hill dwarves construct water and wind mills to power their forges. They are meticulous crafters and skilled tradesdwarves. It is not unheard of for hill dwarves to travel far from their homes to study the craftsmanship of other peoples. Because of this hill dwarves are welcoming of others, only shunning those they believe lack artistic talent, such as goblins or orcs.

Hill dwarves are the shortest of the dwarves, being a few inches shorter than mountain dwarves. They make up for their height by being the heaviest, weighing between 200 and 300 pounds. While most hill dwarves have beards, many trim or even shave them completely if they become an impedance to their craft. They are usually fair skinned with hair to match, with blond, brown and red being most common.

- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Willpower, +1 Stamina, -1 Dexterity
- **Lifespan:** 250 years

##### Craftsdwarf

During a long rest you may enhance a piece of mundane gear, giving it +1 until the next day. At level 10 you can enhance two pieces of gear.

#### Mountain Dwarf

Among all the dwarves, none are as stout or hearty as mountain dwarves. Carving grand kingdoms under the mountains, they spend most of their lives below ground. Mountain dwarves uphold their traditions with an almost zealous fervor, believing that their traditions are what make them dwarves rather than their birth. Because of this dwarves are often staunch followers of the law, putting their clan above themselves.

While dwarves are shorter than humans, standing 4 to 5 feet tall, they are just as heavy. They are naturally strong, able to endure long hours of work even into old age. Dwarves hold their beards and hair in high regard, keeping them well groomed and often braiding or weaving beads and fabric into their beards. Mountain dwarves commonly have black or brown hair, but rarely have red or even blond hair. Their eyes match the metals and gemstones they mine, commonly being silver or gold, but can be a deep blue, red, or green.


- **Starting Wounds:** 4
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/2
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Strength, +1 Stamina, -1 Dexterity
- **Lifespan:** 250 years

##### Hardy

You gain an additional max wound at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28. When resting you remove any poison effecting you.

### Lizardmen

#### Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk live in the deadlier swamps and jungles of the world, forming small clans and tribes for survival. Most lizardfolk are unable to grasp the morals and customs of traditional civilization, their harsh environment giving them a singular focus: to survive. Lizardfolk are well suited to this life as they make deadly warriors, just as dangerous unarmed as they are with a spear or axe. While lizardfolk aren't skilled artisans, they are resourceful, using the bones and hides of their prey to fashion weapons and armor.

Lizardfolk tower over others, with some standing 7 and a half feet tall. With their long tails and hulking bodies, lizardfolk weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Depending on the tribe they come from their scales can take on a multitude of colors, with green, blue, and red being the most common. While lizardfolk are hairless, some tribes have bright feathers covering their heads, extending down their backs.


- **Starting Wounds:** 4
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/2
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Strength, +1 Stamina, -1 Intelligence
- **Lifespan:** 60 years

##### Regeneration

You recover from a minor injury after a short rest. Major injuries that aren't caused by magic or disease are cured after a week.

#### Drake

While lacking the strength of their lizardfolk cousins, drakes use their cunning to survive the deadly environments they call home. Drakes are canny crafters, creating simple yet ingenious creations to aid in their survival. Drakes are almost singularly focused on survival, because of this they rarely experience fear or courage. Drakes rarely leave their lands, but can occasionally seek out allies from others. When they do they are often confused by their companions actions, seemingly unable to understand the morals and behavior of other civilized species.

Drakes are smaller than lizardfolk, standing 5 and a half feet at most. Their bodies are lean, weighing between 150 and 200 pounds. Their large, dragon-like wings allow them to easily glide through the air. Drake scales share the green, blue and red coloring of their cousins, but rarely some drakes are born a metallic bronze color.

### The Empire

### Far Wilds

### The Realms of Creation

### Saints and the Divines

- The world is filled with the divine weave, a force that gives magic/soul to all things.
- Gods are born from the divine weave, are physical manifestations of different parts of the weave
- Gods cannot die, when their physical body is destroyed their essence returns to the weave. Difference between living and dead gods is similar to consciousness and unconsciousness, dead gods power can still be used, felt, but is indirect or without intent.

#### The 8 Pillars of Creation
- the main gods, also called the pillars of creation, are said to have created the world when they coalesced from the divine weave for the first time.
- larger than the regional deities, the pillars of creation cover entire concepts.
- Even though these gods are dead, they're so influential and powerful that their will is still felt through the weave.

- similar to Kella, Ixel gives knowledge to his followers on a whim
- Gladly shares knowledge well beyond the understanding of his subjects, leading to tragedy and madness

##### Umbra, God of Shadows and Silence

##### Molak, God of the Unknown and Sacrifice

#### Lesser Gods
- With the absence of the prime gods, minor gods spring up covering local areas or subsets of the prime gods power. For example a god of the forest, lake or cave, a god of disease or decay instead of death, etc. the more powerful the god the larger area/influence it has.

#### Saints
- Saints are humans imbued with a divine soul, a piece of one of the gods lives in their souls. Saints gain powers from the god their borne from, and may not always have their own will. As saints contain a piece of the divine, they could be used to revive a dead god, sometimes against their will.
- When a saint dies, their soul returns to the divine weave and is absorbed by the gods. In most cases saints cannot be revived, and if someone does manage this difficult feat the saint loses their divine power.

## Bestiary of Monsters

### Monster Level
Each monster is given a Monster Level or Challenge, denoted with a C, that gives a rough estimate of the danger a monster poses to the party. Monster level is comparable to a characters level. For example, a monster with a monster level of 5 should be an average challenge to a 5th level character. When building encounters a good estimate of difficulty is comparing the sum level of all monsters and the sum level of the party.

### Reading a Monster's Stat Block
The monsters in this book are arranged into condensed stat sheets. These stat sheets, or statblocks, have all the information you need to run the monster in combat. Lets take a look at the first monster in this book: the wolf.

#### Wolf
 |                  |      |                |        |
 | :--------------- | ---: | :------------- | -----: |
 | **Defense:**     |  0/2 | **AP:**        |     10 |
 | **Wounds:**      |    2 | **Challenge:** |      1 |
 | **Move/Sprint:** |  5/5 | **Size:**      | Medium |
___
|  STR  |  DEX  |  STA  |  INT  |  WIL  |  CHA  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  1/1  |  2/2  |  1/1  | -2/0  |  0/0  |  0/0  |

___
***Pack-Tactics.*** This creature has Combat Advantage when attacking a creature that is adjacent to an ally.

**Actions**

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack:* 5 AP,  **2/0/3/0/0** _(Dex)_ - On hit deals 1/1 in piercing damage.

***Leap.*** *Melee Attack, Maneuver:* 7 AP, Range 2, **2/0/4/0/0** _(Dex)_ - The wolf leaps up to 2 tiles, ending in a tile adjacent to the target creature. The creature makes a Defense or Dexterity save, taking 1/1 in piercing damage on fail, being knocked prone on a critical.
___

As you can see there is quite a bit going on here. The statblock is broken down into 4 parts: general stats, attribute scores, feats and abilities, and actions and maneuvers.

#### General Stats
This section goes over all the miscellaneous statistics that don't fit into another category, such as how hard the monster is to hit, how many wounds it has, and how challenging the monster is to the party. The 6 statistics listed here are:

- **Defense:** The dice to roll when making a defense save, the first number being Superior Defense and the second being Defense dice.
- **Wounds:** The max wounds of the monster.
- **Move/Sprint:** The monster's move and sprint speed, in tiles.
- **AP:** How many action points this monster has per turn.
- **Challenge:** A rough estimate of this monster's challenge.
- **Size:** How large the monster is, determining how many tiles this monster occupies.

#### Attribute Scores
Next is the monster's attribute scores. The scores are arranged into an array with each attribute having two numbers: the first being the attribute score, with the second being the proficiency score for that attributes save and skills. For simplicities sake, monsters do not use the same method for determining their attribute save proficiency. Instead they use the proficiency score for that particular attribute. The proficiency score also determines their proficiency with skills related to that attribute. For example, the Wolf has a Dexterity score of 2 with a proficiency score of 2. They have 2 proficiency when making Dexterity saves, and 2 proficiency with their acrobatics and stealth skills.

#### Feats and Abilities
The next section contains the monsters feats and abilities. The Wolf in our example has _Pact Tactics_ which gives them combat advantage when their target is adjacent to an ally. These effects are almost always passive, describing some permanent effect or skill the monster possesses.

#### Actions and Maneuvers
The final section describes any special actions or maneuvers a monster can make. Like players, monsters can take all the default actions laid out in the Combat section, such as Move, Sprint, and Use actions. This section will always contain at least one action that replaces the monster's default attack.

Actions in this section follow a standard structure containing everything you need to use the attack. Lets break down the Wolf's _Leap_ action in the example above:

- "***Bite.***" - The name of the action.
- "*Melee Attack, Maneuver:*" - This describes the type of action. In this case it is a melee attack and a maneuver which means it follows the normal rules for maneuvers. This will usually say melee or ranged attack, but im some cases monsters may have special attacks. Special attacks are unique actions that are neither melee or ranged and disregard any rules that would normally govern those attacks.
- "7 AP" - This is the AP cost of the action, but does not take into account effects from the Feats and Abilities section.
- "Range 2" - This section lists all terms that are applicable to the attack, if any. In this case the maneuver has a Range of 2, meaning the wolf can take this action from 2 tiles away. Range does not always mean the attack is ranged, as is the case with the wolf. This can include any term usually listed on a weapon, such as Reach, Loading, or Versatile.
- "**2/0/4/0/0** _(Dex)_" - The dice array used in the attack or ability roll for the action. Dice rolls for monsters are precomputed, meaning you don't need to worry about their attribute or proficiency scores, or any dice added from maneuvers, as is the case in this example. The attribute this roll is based on is listed after the dice array. The dice here are listed from strongest to weakest dice: Superior, Enhanced, Normal, Bad, Terrible. In our example the wolf rolls 2 Superior and 4 Normal dice with this action.
- The remainder of the action explains the effects of the action itself, such as the type and amount of damage dealt on hit, or what roll the target needs to make. If no roll is shown it is assumed the target makes a defense roll. In this example the wolf may move up to 2 tiles attacking a creature, the creature makes a Dexterity save or Defense roll against the attack, the attack deals 1 wound and 1 wound die (shown as 1/1) in piercing damage, and knocks the target prone on a critical.

A vargr's sense of smell, especially the smell of blood, is extremely sensitive. Few creatures can escape a pack of Vargrs that catch their scent. A clever creature may appeal to the vargr's appetite. Vargrs will cease the hunt if there is easier food to catch, only continuing once there is no more food to eat.

#### Cinderbug Swarm
A seemingly benign beetle, cinderbugs burrow into dried out or dead trees to make their nests. A single tree can hold hundreds of hibernating cinderbugs, waiting for the right conditions. Should the tree catch fire the cinderbugs awaken, igniting themselves in the fire, taking flight as a burning swarm.

While the cinderbugs will eventually burn themselves out, cinderbug swarms can last for hours, spreading fire from tree to tree and burning any creatures that happen to be in their way. Cinderbugs lay their eggs in the hot ash left behind in their wake.

Adventurers that don't carefully examine the wood they use for their fires may inadvertently set off a swarm in the middle of their campsite. While the swarm doesn't actively seek out creatures to ignite, they will swarm around creatures that attempt to harm or otherwise put out their fires.

#### Screeching Bear
Screeching bears are large, feathered bears with a razor sharp beak. Living in forests, they mark their territory by scratching off feathers on trees around its border. Perceptive adventurers may spot these feathers, deciding on a new route less they anger the screeching bear.

Quick to anger, screeching bears obsessively patrol their large territories. Should they find another screeching bear, large beast, or party of adventurers they will first try to intimidate them with its ear piercing screech. Should that fail they won't hesitate to attack, regardless of the intruder. The only exception to this behavior is when protecting their young. In this case the screeching bear will intimidate those that draw near its nest, but will only attack out of necessity.

Screeching bears are sensitive to magic, and may track adventurers that otherwise would have passed unharmed though the spells cast while in their territory. They hunt magical creatures above others as their piercing screech can leave them incapacitated.

#### Burrowbeast
Giant mole-like creatures, burrowbeasts are ambush hunters. Digging through the soft dirt and sands, they lie in wait, sensing the vibrations of animals and striking at those that venture too close with their long, hardened teeth. While they are not pack hunters, burrowbeasts will hunt with their mate. While one hides, burrowed, the other will chase unsuspecting animals over their trap.

While burrowbeasts will ignore most large animals, they will gladly hunt a human-sized creature. Attracted to the sound of metal, burrowbeasts will follow adventurers, sometimes for miles, waiting for a chance to ambush them.

Burrowbeasts are nearly blind above ground, mostly relying on their keen sense of smell and touch. Loud noises, especially the clanging of metal, can confuse the burrowbeast, forcing it to burrow back underground to regain its bearings.

#### Mirelurk Stalker
Found in the swamps and marshes of Farhome, Mirelurk stalkers silently prowl the waters. Nearly invisible while submerged, they glide through the swamps until something disturbs the water. If the disturbance comes from a creature the stalker will follow its prey for miles, waiting for an opportune time to strike. Their chitinous plating and venomous claws allow them to hunt nearly any creature that calls the swamp home, and has no issue hunting unsuspecting adventurers. 

However, Mirelurk Stalkers rarely hunt to the death, instead perferring to wound and poison their prey. They use their posion to track their prey across the swamp, ambushing and retreating as many times as it takes to kill their prey. Once killed, Stalkers may leave their meal for days, letting the poison spoil the meat into something they can more easily digest.

Demands must be something the other creature is capable of fufilling. For example, demanding the other creature take no hostile actions against you or your allies or to speak the truth are valid demands, while demanding to be given the power of flight from an animal is not. Even unreasonable demands may be valid if the other creature truly believes it is within their ability to grant. For example, you could demand a peasant make you king if the peasant believes he can achieve it.

Unless specificed in the demand, there is no set timeframe the demand must be completed. However, creatures are compelled to take actions that do not hinder their ability to complete their demands. For example, delaying to warn of incoming danger to someone you made a pact to protect would violate the pact.
