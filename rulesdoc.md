## Introduction

Farhome is a homebrew tabletop RPG system set in a fantasy world of magic, monsters, and adventures. You and a group of friends play in a shared storytelling experience, each creating a character to experience the world through. Your guide through this world is taken on by another player called the Dungeon Master (or Game Master). Together you might explore an ancient ruin, defend a village from monsters, or fight a dragon.

### How to Play

Farhome is a game about roleplaying and that means, well, playing a role. And while that may sound vague, at it's core roleplaying is about deciding which actions your character wishes to take and how your character responds to actions taken by others. To some this might be done by speaking in character, some describe what their character does, and others will say which action they want to take. The important thing while playing a role is that these choices come from Baranor the barbarian and not Steve the accountant.

Your guide through all of this is the Dungeon Master. They're in charge of everything in the world that isn't the players, from the forest or towns you explore, to the people you interact with, and to the dangerous monsters you fight. Their job is to present to you the world so that your characters can make decisions. The role of the DM boils down to presenting the world to the players, listening to what actions they players wish to take, and then presenting the outcome of those actions. 

What actions you take and the world they are taken in are limited only by your imagination, although there is more structure here than just make-believe. This book contains a multitude of rules (more guidelines really) that give structure and consistency to your adventures. Still, there are cases where the outcome is uncertain, for example does your attack hit the monster, are you able to climb this cliff, or evade the town guards. In these cases you roll dice to determine wether you succeed or fail.

### Rolling Dice

Farhome uses a set of 6-sided dice to determine outcomes. There are 9 types of 6-sided dice, each with their own layout of successes or failures. With most dice rolls you roll a number of dice determined by your characters skills or abilities and a number of challenge dice added by the DM depending on how difficult the task is. Rolling more successes than failures means your action succeeded, while a tie or worse means your action failed. Sometimes your roll may be in opposition to another characters roll, in which case success goes to whoever has the most successes.

Some dice have special symbols on them for Criticalical Successes and Criticalical Failures. By default these are counted as 2 success or 2 failures, but in some cases may give different results. Defense dice work similarly to the other dice, having defense symbols instead of successes. Finally wound dice are used to determine damage, healing, or in some cases chance.

#### Legend
- CS -- Criticalical Success
- S -- Success
- F -- Fail
- CF -- Criticalical Fail
- D -- Defend
- CD -- Criticalical Defend
- W -- Wound

#### Dice Values
| Die | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Superior  | CS | Sx2 | S | S| S | _ |
| Proficient  | CS | S | S | S | _ | _ |
| Normal | S | S | S | _ | _ | F |
| Bad | _ | _ | F | F | F | CF |
| Terrible | _ | F | F | F | Fx2 | CF |
| Defense | CD | D | D | D | _ | _ |
| Superior Defense | CD | CD | Dx2 | D | _ | _ |
| Wound | W | W | W | _ | _ | _ |
| Hero | S | S | Sx2 | Sx2 | CS | CS |

### Calculating a Roll
When calculating your roll, regardless of type, you always add up your own dice first. Success and failures of the same type cancel each other out, Failures nullify Success, and Criticalical Failure nullify Criticalical Success. Add up the remaining successes, counting Criticalical Success as two successes.

At this stage process any modifiers from abilities, skills or features that effect your roll. For example, you would process the Hex condition here, nullifying a remaining critical. If you do not have at least 1 success at this point the roll is considered a fail.

Comparing rolls follows the same rules: Opponents remaining successes nullify your successes, and their criticals nullify your criticals. Finally, if you have 1 or more successes the roll is a success. Ties favor the defender if there is one, or the most neutral action.

#### Determining What Dice to Roll
With the exception of Defense rolls, your Attributes and Proficiencies determine what dice you roll. Defense rolls use Defense and Superior Defense dice, while other rolls use Superior, Proficient, Normal, Bad, and Terrible dice. Wound dice are used to determine how much damage an action does, such as hitting a goblin with a sword or casting _Firebolt_.

Rolls that use your Attributes will have one Attribute and one Proficiency score that determines what dice you use. For example, attacking with melee weapons uses your Strength attribute and has a different Proficiency score depending on if your using a one-handed or two-handed weapon. For these rolls you start with 5 Normal dice. For every Attribute point you have, replace a Normal die with a Proficient die. Next, for every Proficiency point you have, replace a Proficient die with a Superior die. Proficiency does not replace Normal dice, you only benefit from proficiency up to your Attribute score.

In the case where you have a negative number for your Attribute score, replace a Normal die with a Bad die. If your Proficiency score is negative, replace a Proficient die with a Normal die, or a Bad die with a Terrible die.

Through feats, spells, or items you may have an Attribute score greater than 5. In this case for every point above 5 you have you add a Normal die, replacing it with a Proficient die for every Proficiency score above 5.

##### Defense Rolls
When making a defense roll you use Defense and Superior Defense dice. The number and type of dice you roll is determined by what armor your wearing. You roll 2 Defense dice when not wearing any armor or the armors value if you have armor equipped. Holding a shield adds either a Defense or Superior Defense die, depending on the shield.

##### Attribute Saves
Attribute Saves use the same rules as rolling a skill that uses an Attribute, with one exception: negative Attribute scores do not replace Normal dice with Bad dice. This means the lowest you can roll for an Attribute save is 5 Normal dice.

##### Hero Dice
Hero dice are special dice players can add to any roll. You gain a number of them at the start of your adventure and once spent are not replenished. You can add at most 1 Hero die to any roll, except wound rolls. You may choose to add a Hero dice even after you have rolled, as long as you haven't seen the opposing roll.

Your DM may reward you with extra Hero dice, but Hero dice are usually only given at the start of each adventure.

##### Skill Challenge
Skill Challenges are rarely made in contest, instead the DM will ask you to add dice depending on how challenging a task you are trying to accomplish. Each skill has its own proficiency and uses one of your attributes to determine dice. For example, an athletics check will use your Strength score while an acrobatics check will use your Dexterity score. Both athletics and acrobatics have their own proficiencies as well.

The outcome in these rolls isn't always a strict pass or fail, depending on the DM they may give a bonus if you roll a critical success or something bad may happen if you roll a critical fail.

##### Helping in Skill Challenges
In some cases you may want to help someone with an action, such as trying to push a boulder or search a room. When helping every participant rolls the same skill check contested by a single challenge roll. The highest roll among the participants is used, adding a success for every crit rolled by others.

##### Challenge Difficulty Dice
| Difficulty | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:----:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Simple  | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Easy  | B | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Average | B | B | _ | _ | _ |
| Hard | B | B | T | _ | _ |
| Difficult | B | B | T | T | _ |
| Impossible | B | B | T | T | T |

### Wounds

Wounds are used to determine how hard a character is to kill, the more wounds you have the more durable your character. Wounds are lost when you are hit by attacks, spells, or traps and are restored by taking rests or through certain spells.

Some abilities or effects inflict Lesser or Greater wounds. These do not deal damage, but do leave lasting effects. Lesser wounds can be cured through magic, or heal naturally over a long rest. Greater wounds can be difficult to cure by magic and do not heal naturally.

### Death Saves

When a character takes enough damage to drop them to 0 wounds or below they become unconscious and start making death saves. While unconscious in this way you gain temporary wounds equal to half your total wounds rounded up. At the start of each of your turns you roll a wound die, losing 1 of your temporary wounds if the die rolls a wound. If you lose all of your temporary wounds your character dies.

Death saves aren't the only way you can lose temporary wounds, creatures can still make attacks against you and any melee attacks that hit you deal full damage regardless of the wound dice rolled. Likewise, allies can attempt to bring you back with healing spells, potions, or by stabilizing you. While in this state healing effects restore any lost temporary wounds first before restoring your wounds. If this brings you 1 wound or above you regain consciousness and no longer make death saves.

You can attempt to stabilize a character by making a medicine check. The check takes 10 AP and you must be beside the downed character to make it. Roll a medicine check, adding a Terrible die for every temporary wound the character is missing. On success the character is stabilized, on fail the character restores a temporary wound for every crit success in your medicine check. A stabilized players's wounds are set to 1 and they no longer make death saving throws, gaining consciousness after 10 minutes.

### Action Points

Action Points (AP) are used during combat as a way of tracking how much you can get done during your turn. Action Points are refilled at the start of your turn and are spent taking actions, such as moving, attacking, or casting spells. Any unspent Action Points can be spent on reactions even when it's not your turn. Reactions are triggered by specific actions, for example opportunity attacks can only be made when a creature tries to leave your zone of control. At the start of your next turn you lose any unspent Action Points from the previous turn.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities that can be learned by your character. They can be learned by anyone, but most maneuvers require a weapon to be used. Using a maneuver is the same as taking any other action during your turn, however they have the following restrictions:

- You may only use one maneuver per turn, reaction maneuvers excluded.
- You cannot use the same maneuver on two consecutive turns in a row.

Additionally, most maneuvers have weapon or level requirements, or can only be used in specific situations, such as when an ally is attacked. The level requirement for maneuvers shows 2 levels, the first being the level you need to learn the maneuver and the second being it's enhanced level. When your character reaches the maneuver's enhanced level it gains the effects described in the 'enhanced' textblock.

### Healing Surge

Healing surges are used to heal wounds your character has suffered during a short or long rest. Your character starts with healing surges equal to your stamina score (minimum of 1) and gains an extra healing surge every 5 levels. When spending a healing surge you roll 3 wound dice, healing for the number of wounds rolled. You can spend any number of healing surges during a short or long rest. After each long rest you regain up to 3 of your spent healing surges.

### Combat Advantage

Some abilities may impose combat advantage against you or an enemy. Someone who grants combat advantage are easier to hit, giving anyone who makes an attack or spell attack against the creature an extra superior die to their roll.

### Attributes
Your characters aptitude is represented by 6 core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence, Willpower, Charisma. Each attribute governs a number of skills in addition to the following:

#### Strength
Each point of Strength adds a die to your melee attacks.

#### Dexterity
Each point of Dexterity adds a die to your ranged attacks and melee weapons with the _finesse_ property.

#### Stamina
Each point of Stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

#### Intelligence
Each point of Intelligence adds a die to your Arcane spellcasting rolls.

#### Willpower
Each point of Willpower adds a die to your Curse spellcasting rolls.

#### Charisma
Each point of Charisma adds a die to your Divine spellcasting rolls.

## Proficiency
Proficiency is a measure of how capable your character is at a given skill or task. Every skill, weapon type, spell school, tool, and attribute save have their own proficiency values which can be increased as your character grows. With the exception of spell schools, there is no limit on how many skills you can be proficient in. 

Some feats or abilities grant you expertise in a specific skill. When rolling a skill you have expertise in you may reroll 3 dice, taking the new values.


### Skills

Skills represent how good your character is at completing different tasks and actions. Each skill has an associated attribute, and each skill has it's own proficiency modifier. There are no restrictions for which skills a player can add proficiency for.

### Tools

To use tools, you need to have at least 1 proficiency in the tool skill. Their full use is shown in the Appendix.

| Tool | Attribute |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Repair Kit | Strength |
| Apothecary Set  | Willpower |
| Enchanters Tools | Intelligence |

### Attribute Saves

Each core attribute has an associated attribute save. Attribute saves are a measure of how resistant your character is to specific spells or effects. For example, someone trying to shove you would make a roll against your Strength save, or dodging a trap would roll against your Dexterity save.

### Spell Schools

There are 3 schools of magic: Arcane, Curse, and Divine. Each school uses its own proficiency, and can only be learned through feats or during character creation.

### Weapons

Weapons are split between simple and martial weapons. Simple weapons can be used by anyone and don't use their own proficiency modifier. Instead you use the relevant martial proficiency. When using a martial weapon that you don't have proficiency with you add 1 terrible die to the attack roll.

Weapon proficiencies are split between 4 categories: One Handed, Two Handed, Ranged, and Unarmed.

## Spells

Spells are split into 3 schools: Arcane, Curse, and Divine. Each school handles a different type of spell and uses a different attribute for its spellcasting. Arcane spells use the elements and raw power to defeat their foes, using Intelligence for its attribute. Curse spells disable and debuff their targets and uses Willpower. Divine spells center around healing and buffing targets and uses Charisma.

To cast a spell you must have a codex containing the spell you want to cast, have the spell prepared, and have a spell slot with a high enough level to cast the spell.

### Spellbooks

Very few creatures are able to innately cast magic. Almost everyone must prepare spells they've written into a spellbook, or Codex. There is no limit on the school, level, or type of spell you can hold in your Codex. New spells can be added to your Codex by copying from spell scrolls or a codex. This process is destructive, and destroys the scroll or codex after a spell is copied.

##### Variant Rule - Spells from Codexes
In some games spells may be limited, or codecies a rare occurance. With this variant when copying a spell from a codex, instead of destroying the codex you make an Arcana check against 2 bad dice. On success codex is not destroyed. Regardless a spell can only be copied once.

### Spell Slots

Casting spells of 1st level and above takes a toll on the caster, a character can only cast so many of these spells before needing to rest. To cast a spell you need a spell slot with a level equal to or greater than the spells level. Once a spell slot is used you cannot use that spell slot again until you complete a rest.

### Preparing Spells

Before you can cast a spell from your Codex you must prepare it. Every long rest you can prepare 5 spells, adding 3 for every point of Intelligence you have. Having negative Intelligence does not reduce the number of spells you can prepare.

Once prepared spells are castable until the next day, even without your Codex. The spells fade from your memory over the next long rest unless you prepare them again.

### Casting Spells

Each spell has either an AP cost or a time given as its casting time. There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast a turn, as long as you have the AP to do so. Casting a spell that lists a time instead of AP can still be used in combat, but requires the casting time worth of full turns. For example casting a spell with a cast time of 1 minute requires 3 full turns to cast.

All spells, including cantrips, can be cast at a higher level if you have a spell slot available. Casting spells this way give additional effects listed in the spell.

### Concentration

Some spells require concentration to maintain. You may only concentrate on a single spell at a time, casting a new spell with concentration will end the effects of the previous spell.

When you take damage while concentrating on a spell you must pass a Stamina save or the spell ends, adding 1 terrible die, plus a terrible die for every wound taken from the attack.

### Cantrips

Cantrips are spells that do not require a spell slot to cast, but must still be prepared like the rest of your spells. For casting at a higher level, cantrips are considered level 0 spells and gain benefits when even a 1st level spell slot is used to cast it.

### Variant Rule - Misfires

While anyone can cast any spell they have a spell slot for, trying to cast a spell beyond your abilities can lead to a misfire. When casting a spell beyond your ability, either normally or through upcasting a different spell, you add 2 terrible die to the spellcasting roll for every rank beyond your ability. If you do not have any remaining successes before contesting with another roll the spell misfires. Roll on the misfire chart to determine the effect.

##### Ability Ranks
| Attribute | Spell Levels |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | 1-2 |
| 2  | 3-4 |
| 3 | 5-6 |
| 4 | 7-8 |
| 5 | 9 |


##### Misfire Chart

Roll 2 bad dice, counting the successes.

| Roll | Misfire |
|:----:|:-------------|
| -4  | Lesser Wound: Mana leak. Every time you take at least 1 wound you lose your lowest spell slot available. Lasts until cured with _Treat Injury_ or you take a Long Rest. |
| -3 | Your spell backfires, roll a wound die for every remaining failure from your spellcasting roll, taking a wound for every wound rolled. |
| -2 | Wild magic fills the area around you, you and all creatures within 3 tiles add 1 terrible die to their next roll |
| -1 | Your flow of magic is interrupted, you add 1 terrible die to all spellcasting rolls for the next minute |
| 0 | Minor backlash. You take 1 wound of Force damage |
| 1-2 | The magic fades, but no harm comes from it. |


## Creating a Character
Farhome has no classes or archtypes beyond the background feats you choose. Every player is free to create their character as they wish.

To begin, choose a race for your character. The race determines your starting wounds, how far you can move or sprint, as well as your starting stat bonuses. Each race has a unique feat that all people of their race share. Choose a background feat for your character. These feats can only be gained during character creation and determine what kind of skills or abilities your character has learned.

Next, assign your attribute scores. You start with a -1 to all attribute scores, applying any bonuses from your race, and finally adding 9 points split across your attributes. Increasing an attribute score above 3 costs 2 points, and no attribute can be above 5.

You gain 4 proficiency points to spend on your skills and saving throws. If you have a background or feat that gives you proficiency in a spell school you may increase your spellcasting proficiency.

Finally, choose 2 of the following bonuses.

#### Starting Bonuses
- Increase an Attribute by 1, with a max of 3
- Gain proficiency in a magic type
- Gain 4 proficiency points
- Learn 1 Feat
- Learn a maneuver and gain 2 proficiency with a weapon type
- Increase your max wounds by 1

##### Variant Rule - Rolling for Attributes
Instead of using the rules above for attributes, your group may decide to roll your scores. For each attribute roll 1 Superior, 3 Normal, and 1 Terrible die, adding up the total successes. The minimum score for an attribute is -2, with any rolls below that counting as -2 for the roll.

### Starting Equipment.
Depending on your background you may start with additional gear. All players start with an adventuring kit containing a bedroll, 10 days of rations, a fire starter and 50ft of rope. In addition you start with 50 gold which you can spend on gear or upgrades. Any unspent gold becomes your characters starting money.

| Cost | Upgrade |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5g  | Buy any simple weapon. |
| 10g | Cantrip or Level 1 Spell |
| 10g | Basic Healing Potion |
| 10g | Buckler |
| 15g | Padded or Studded armor. |
| 15g | any martial weapon. |
| 20g | Upgrading armor to the next type |

### Leveling Up

When you earn 1000 experience your character levels up. Each level you gain 2 proficiency points and choose one of the following bonuses:

- Gain up to 4 spell slots*
- Gain 4 proficiency points
- Gain a Feat
- Learn a Maneuver
- Increase your max wounds by 1

##### Spell Slots
The sum total of spell slots gained each level cannot exceed twice your Spell level, and each spell slot cannot exceed your Spell level. 

For example, a 2nd level player has a spell level of 1, and so can gain 2 level 1 spell slots. A 4th level character can get 2 2nd level spell slots, or 1 2nd level and 2 1st, or 4 1st level spell slots.

| Player Level | Spell Level | Player Level | Spell Level |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 1st  | 1st | 15th | 6th |
| 3rd  | 2nd | 18th | 7th |
| 6th | 3rd | 21st | 8th |
| 9th | 4th | 24th | 9th |
| 12th | 5th | 27th | 10th |


#### Attribute Score increase
Starting at level 3, every 3 levels you can increase an attribute by 1.

#### Action Points
You gain an Action Point at levels 10 and 20.

### Earning Experience
Players earn experience after every encounter based on the difficulty of the encounter. Ideally characters should be leveling up once every 4-8 encounters. Experience is earned based on how difficult it is for the players to overcome the encounter, not by how much experience an individual monster gives.


##### Encounters
| Difficulty | Experience | CR level |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Easy  | 100 | 75% Party Level |
| Average  | 100-250 | Party Level |
| Hard | 250-500 | 125% Party Level |

#### Variant - Milestones
An alternative to experience is milestones. Experience can in some cases be hard to keep consistent across adventures and can lead to some gameification problems with players. With milestones you gain a level after completing an adventure, or a portion of one.

## Combat

Combat is broken down into rounds where every combatant gets a turn. Turn order is handled by each characters initiative roll. Each round lasts ~20 seconds in in-game time.

#### Initiative

When combat starts every player rolls for initiative. By default, you roll 5 normal dice, improving 1 to proficient dice for every point of dexterity you have, with negative dex converting die to bad die.

You add a flat success/fail modifier depending on the circumstances. Surprised creatures start with 3 failures. Unarmored creatures get 1 success, light armor gets none, medium armor gets 1 failure, and heavy armoy gets 2 failures. These values can be changed by feats or skills, and other dice may be added.

### On your turn

Each turn your action points are refilled. You can spend any amount of AP on your turn, and any unused AP can be used on reactions during the rest of the round. You gain no benefit for any unspent AP when your turn comes again.

#### Attack (5 AP)
Make a single weapon attack against a target creature. The actual damage, range, and effects of an attack depend on the individual weapon. Unarmed attacks use Strength and use a wound die to determine if the attack deals damage.

To make an attack you must succeed an attack roll vs the targets defense. You roll normal dice equal to your Strength/Dexterity, depending on what attribute the weapon uses. If you are proficient, improve a number of normal dice to proficient dice equal to your proficiency. If you have more successes vs the targets defense you hit. Draws are in favor of the defender.

##### Grapple
Instead of making an attack you can attempt to grapple a creatrure. Make an atheletics check against a creatures Strength or Dexterity save, their choice. On success the creature is grappled. While grappling a creature your move and sprint speed are reduced to 1 and cannot be increased, however the grappled creature is dragged with you.

You may end a grapple at any time. A grappled creature can attempt to free themselves on their turn in place of taking the attack action. To free yourself, you must pass a Strength save against the grapplers Atheletics.

#### Defend (5 AP)
Until your next turn you reroll 2 dice when making a defense roll, taking the new value. If you're holding a shield reroll 3 dice instead.

#### Move (3 AP, once per turn)
You may move up to your move speed in tiles. Some terrain may cost more than 1 tile's worth of movespeed. Movement does not have be done all at once, you can split your movement as many times as you want.

#### Sprint (2 AP, can only be used after move, once per turn)
You may move up to your sprint speed + Dexterity score in tiles. Negative Dexterity doesn't reduce the number of tiles you can sprint.

#### Reaction Attack (2 AP)
When a creature tries to leave your zone of control (the 5 adjacent tiles in front of your character, making a U shape) you may make a reaction attack against them. You cannot use maneuvers (unless the maneuver says it can be used as a reaction) and the attack uses the default Attack rules.

#### Off-hand Attack (2 AP, can only be used after attack, once per turn)
When dual wielding, as long as you have made a single 'Attack' action, you may make an attack with your offhand weapon. This attack is identical to the 'Attack' action, except you do not get any bonus from proficiency.

#### Use (2 AP)
The default for using an item, drinking a potion, activating a magic item, or interacting with an object (eg: pulling a switch). Some magic items will give their own AP costs, using those instead. You can only drink one potion each round.

##### Variant Rule: Using potions on others
You can use potions on willing or downed creatures by spending 5 AP instead of 2. Normal potion rules still apply.

#### Spell (Varying AP)
There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast, as long as you have enough AP to cast them. Most spells will require you to make a Spellcasting roll. These use normal dice equal to the spells spellcasting attribute: either Intelligence, Willpower, or Charisma. If you are proficient in that spell type, improve a number of normal dice to proficient dice equal to your proficiency modifier.


#### Maneuver (Varying AP)
Maneuvers have a variety of triggers, but unless otherwise stated must be used on your turn. Each turn you can use a single maneuver, after which that maneuver can't be used the next turn. You can still use a different maneuver the next turn.

### The Gameboard
Many DM's will represent their world with a gameboard, with every tile on the board representing a 5 ft square in the world. Usually only a single creature can occupy 1 tile at a time. Some creatures can occupy more or than one tile. All abilities, spells and feats in Farhome uses tiles to determine distance.

##### Creature Size
| Size | Tile's Occupied |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  | 1/4th |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium | 1 |
| Large | 2x2 |
| Huge | 3x3 |
| Gargantuant | 4x4+ |

#### Zone of Control
A creatures zone of control is used to determine what other creatures they are locked in combat and which tiles count as flanking. By default a creatures zone of controls are the 5 adjacent tiles centered in the direction the creature is facing. If a creature is facing north, his zone of control is the west, north-west, north, north-east, and east tiles. Some abilities and weapons, such as _Reach_ increase a creatures zone of control.

A creature that attempts to leave another creatures zone of control is open to opportunity attacks.

#### Flanking
When a creature is attacked from a tile that is not in their zone of control it is considered a flanking attack. Flanking gives no bonus in and of itself, but some abilities and feats grant bonuses for flanking.

##### Variant Rule: Combat Advantage From Flanking
With this rule attacking a creature from behind grants Combat Advantage for the attack. This effects both player attacks and attacks from NPCs.

#### Darkness
Most creatures are unable to see in the dark, and take various penalities to all rolls made against creatures or targets in the dark. For example, a guard trying to spot a thief in the dark will take penalties, but a thief in the dark attacking a guard holding a torch will not.

Creatures in dim light add 1 bad die to all rolls, while creatures in total darkness add 2 terrible dice.

#### Cover
Creatures hiding behind objects and terrain gain bonus defense dice depending on how much cover the objects provide. For example, a fence or bush might provide quarter cover, a fallen tree or brick fence would provide half, and an upturned table or door would provide 3 quarters cover.

| Cover | Bonus |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Quarter  | +1 Superior Defense die |
| Half  | +2 Superior Defense dice |
| 3 Quarters | +3 Superior Defense dice |
| Full | Untargetable |

## Resting
During the adventuring day you will sometimes need to take a rest to recover health and abilities. There are two types of rests: Short rests which take an hour and Long rests which take 8. Each day you can have at most two short rests and one long rest. Any more more rests then that have no effect.

### Short Rest

Short rests require an hour of uninterrupted rest to complete. During a short rest you may spend any number of healing surges to restore lost wounds. 

Spellcasters restore up to 1/3rd of their level, rounded up, in spell slots. You may restore any number of spell slots this way as long as the sum level is not greater than 1/3rd of your level.

### Long Rest

Long rests require 8 hours of rest, with at most 2 hours of non-strenuous activity, such as keeping watch, preparing spells, brewing potions, etc. You automatically recover 1 wound and 3 healing surges over a long rest, and you may spend any number of healing surges to restore wounds.

Spellcasters restore up to their level in spell slots. You may restore any number of spell slots this way as long as the sum level is not greater than your level. In addition you may prepare new spells for the day.

### Exhaustion
All adventurers need to rest from time to time, trying to do too much in a day can leave you exhausted. You can gain exhaustion from many places, from travelling too long, not taking rests, spells, or abilities. At 6 levels of exhaustion you drop dead.

A normal travelling day is 8 hours. For every 2 hours you travel past 8 you must make an exhaustion roll. At 10 hours, you make a roll against 2 Bad dice, on fail you gain a level of exhaustion and can't travel further. The difficulty of this roll increases by 1 terrible die each roll past the 1st.

If you go more than 24 hours without taking a long rest you must make an exhaustion save vs 2 bad dice and 1 terrible die. You make this check every 24 hours without a long rest.

##### Exhaustion Levels
| Level | Proficiency | Max Wounds | Sprint
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | -1 | 0 | Yes |
| 2  | -1 | -1 | Yes |
| 3 | -2 | -2 | No |
| 4 | -2 | -3 | No |
| 5 | -3 | -4 | No |

## Conditions
There are a number of conditions creatures can be subjected to, each with different effects. Some conditions have a level associated with them to determine how extreme that condition is. For example, Poison normally adds a terrible die to your attack rolls and saving throws, where Poison 2 and Poison 3 adds 2 and 3 terrible die respectively.

##### Blind
A blinded creature loses the ability to see. While blind they add 2 Terrible die to all attack, spellcasting, and dexterity saving throws. They cannot make reactions.

##### Dazed
A dazed creature cannot take the Sprint or Reaction actions and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Fear
a feared creature cannot willingly move closer to the source of the fear. While the source is within line of sight, they add 1 bad die to any rolls made.

##### Grapple
A grappled creature cannot move and adds 2 bad die to dexterity saving throws, and grants combat advantage to attackers, except for the grappler.

##### Hex
A Hexxed creature ignores the first critical for all rolls. Criticals ignored this way count as rolling a blank side, eg: do not trigger critical effects or give successes. Each level of Hex ignores an extra critical.

##### Incapacitated
An incapacitated creature takes no actions and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

##### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature automatically fail dexterity saving throws. When taking any Action they must first roll a Wound die. If the result is a wound they do not take the action and lose the AP spent.

##### Poison
A poisoned creature adds a terrible die to all attacks, saving throws, and ability checks, adding a terrible die for every level of poison. Only the highest level poison takes effect, eg: someone who has Poison and Poison 2 only adds 2 terrible die instead of 3. At the end of each of your turns you roll a Stamina save vs 1 Bad die, adding a Terrible die for each level of Poison. On success you reduce the level of Poison by 1.

##### Prone
a prone creature grants combat advantage to any melee attacker. Ranged attacks against this creature add 2 bad dice to their roll.

##### Restrained
A restrained creature cannot move and adds 2 bad die to dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. They lose the effects of a shield if wearing one and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Slowed
A slowed creature's Move and Sprint speeds are reduced by 1. Each level of slow reduces the value by 1, to a minimum of 1.

##### Stagger
A staggered creature is unable to take reactions.

##### Stunned
A stunned creature cannot move or take actions, and automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attackers gain combat advantage against this target.

##### Weaken
When a weakened creature hits with any attack or maneuver, all guaranteed wounds are replaced with Wound dice, dealing a wound only if the die rolls a wound.

## Magic Items

Magic items give a variety of effects and bonuses. Only some magic items require attunement, and each character can only attune with 3 magic items at a time. While you can carry multiple magic items of the same type, you can only get the benefit of one of them. For example, you cannot get the benefit of a _Cloak of Shadows_ as well as a _Cloak of Waterbreathing_.

### Attunement

Some powerful magic items require attunement to use. To attune to a magic item you must spend a long rest with the item. If you are already attuned to 3 magic items you must choose which item to lose attunement to when attuning to a new item.


### Magic Weapons

Magic weapons usually come with a bonus modifier, from +1 to +3. When making attack rolls with these weapons you add a superior die for every bonus modifier.

### Magic Armor

Magic armors can come with bonus modifiers from +1 to +3. When making defense rolls with this armor you add a superior defense die for every bonus modifier.
<br></br>
Shields cannot have bonus modifiers, but can have additional effects.

### Identifying Magic Items

Magic items can be identified by a successful Lore challenge. Each character can only attempt a lore roll once, if you fail then you must either cast _Identify_ on the item or take it to someone who can appraise it.

You can still use magic items without identifying them, but its bonuses will be unknown to you.

### Gaining Attributes through Items

Some magic items grant bonuses to your attributes. While there is no limit on how much this can increase an attribute, you cannot benefit from two items that give bonuses to the same attribute, instead taking only the larger one.

For example, using a _Cloak of Agility_ granting +1 Dexterity and a _Belt of Elvenkind_ granting +2 Dexterity will only give you +2 to your Dexterity attribute. You still benefit from the remaining bonuses on those items.

#### Scribing Tools
A set of tools for writing spell scrolls and inscribing runes. During a long rest you may attempt to inscribe a single rune or spell scroll. Spell scrolls are written in a way such that anyone is able to learn it and add it to their codex. Runes are consumables that give a variety of one time effects, from enhancing one of your spells to creating a magical trap. Creating scrolls and wards requires spell slots and uses a mix of gemstones and enchanting supplies which can be found in most cities.

#### Inscribing Spell Scrolls
You can create a spell scroll for any spell in your codex that you are able to cast. Creating a spell scroll of 3rd level or lower can be done during a long rest, with spells of 4th level and higher taking 1 day of work for each level above 3rd. You must have a spell slot of the same level or higher available which is consumed in creating the scroll.

When copying spells from a Codex you can instead use your scribing tools to create a spell scroll. Doing so costs a single enchanting supply regardless of spell level, but ignores all other costs for creating spell scrolls. For each spell you want to remove from the Codex and turn into a scroll make a inscription roll against that spell levels difficulty. On success you create a spell scroll for that spell, with failure destroying the codex.
